This tutorial explains how to use Aspose.Words for .NET to insert a column chart into a document. The provided source code demonstrates how to create a chart, add series data, and save the document.

## Step 1: Set up the project

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it by using NuGet package manager to install it.
- A document directory path where the output document will be saved.

## Step 2: Create a new document and insert a chart

Create a new `Document` object and a `DocumentBuilder` to build the document.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

Next, use the `InsertChart` method of the `DocumentBuilder` to insert a column chart into the document.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

## Step 3: Add series data to the chart

Add series data to the chart. In this example, we'll add two categories and their corresponding values.

```csharp
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1", new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2" }, new double[] { 1, 2 });
```

## Step 4: Save the document

Finally, save the document to the specified directory using the `Save` method of the `Document` object.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.InsertColumnChart.docx");
```

This completes the implementation of inserting a column chart using Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Example source code for Insert Column Chart using Aspose.Words for .NET

	Chart chart = shape.Chart;
	chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1", new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2" }, new double[] { 1, 2 });
	doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.InsertColumnChart.docx");
```
