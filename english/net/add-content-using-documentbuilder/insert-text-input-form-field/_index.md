In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to use the Insert Text Input Form Field feature in Aspose.Words for .NET to add and manipulate text input form fields in your Word documents using C# source code. Text input form fields allow users to enter custom text within a document, making them ideal for creating interactive forms and questionnaires. By following the instructions below, you will be able to effortlessly insert and customize text input form fields in your documents. Let's get started!

## Introduction to Insert Text Input Form Field feature in Aspose.Words for .NET

The Insert Text Input Form Field feature in Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to add text input form fields programmatically to your Word documents. These form fields provide an interactive element where users can enter custom text or data.

## Understanding the requirements for using the feature

Before proceeding with the implementation, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET library installed in your project.
2. Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
3. An existing Word document or a new document to insert the text input form field.

Make sure you have these prerequisites in place to proceed smoothly.

## Step-by-step guide to implementing Insert Text Input Form Field using C# source code

Follow the steps below to implement the Insert Text Input Form Field feature using the provided C# source code:

### Step 1: Initializing the document and document builder

To start, initialize the document and the document builder. The document builder is a powerful tool provided by Aspose.Words for .NET that allows us to construct and manipulate Word documents programmatically. Use the following code snippet:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

### Step 2: Inserting the Text Input Form Field

Next, we will insert the text input form field into the document using the `InsertTextInput` method. This method accepts various parameters, including the name of the form field, the type of form field (in this case, `TextFormFieldType.Regular`), the default value, and the maximum length. Here's an example:

```csharp
builder.InsertTextInput("TextInput", TextFormFieldType.Regular, "", "Hello", 0);
```

The above code will insert a text input form field with the name "TextInput", a default value of "Hello", and no maximum length restriction.

### Step 3: Saving the document

After inserting the text input form field, save the document to the desired location using the `Save` method. Make sure to provide the appropriate file path:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "AddContentUsingDocumentBuilder.InsertTextInputFormField.docx");
```

This code will save the document with the inserted text input form field at the specified location.

### Example source code for Insert Text Input Form Field using Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder.InsertTextInput("TextInput", TextFormFieldType.Regular, "", "Hello", 0);

doc.Save(dataDir + "AddContentUsingDocumentBuilder.InsertTextInputFormField.docx");
```
