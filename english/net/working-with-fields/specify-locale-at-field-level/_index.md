Here is a step-by-step guide to explain the following C# source code that allows specifying localization at the field level using the Aspose.Words for .NET feature. Make sure you have included the Aspose.Words library in your project before using this code.

## Step 1: Set document directory path

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DIRECTORY_OF_DOCUMENTS";
```

Be sure to specify the correct path to your documents directory where the edited document will be saved.

## Step 2: Create a document generator

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
```

Here we are creating an instance of the `DocumentBuilder` class which will allow us to add fields to the document.

## Step 3: Insert a date field with a specific location

```csharp
Field field = builder. InsertField(FieldType.FieldDate, true);
field.LocaleId = 1049;
```

We use the document generator to insert a field of type `FieldType.FieldDate` into the document. By setting the `LocaleId` property to `1049`, we specify the Russian localization for this field.

## Step 4: Save the modified document

```csharp
builder.Document.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFields.SpecifylocaleAtFieldlevel.docx");
```

Finally, we save the modified document with the specified location to a specified file.

### Sample source code for specifying field-level localization with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DIRECTORY_OF_DOCUMENTS";

DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();

Field field = builder. InsertField(FieldType.FieldDate, true);
field.LocaleId = 1049;

builder.Document.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFields.SpecifylocaleAtFieldlevel.docx");
```

This was an example source code to specify localization at the field level in a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. You can use this code to insert date fields with specific locations in your Word documents.
