Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

```csharp
doc.Range.Fields.Where(f => f.Type == FieldType.FieldIf).ToList().ForEach(f => f.Unlink());
```

## Step 5: Save the transformed document
Use the `Save()` method to save the document with the fields converted to text in the specified document directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFields.ConvertFieldsInDocument.docx");
```
