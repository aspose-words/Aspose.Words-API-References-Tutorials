## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of applying a license from a file using the Aspose.Words for .NET library. Aspose.Words is a powerful document processing library that allows you to create, modify, and convert Word documents programmatically. To unlock the full functionality of Aspose.Words, you need to apply a valid license. We will demonstrate how to apply a license by loading it from a file in C#.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Words for .NET library installed on your system.
- A valid license file for Aspose.Words. 

## Step 1: Import the Aspose.Words Namespace
To get started, you need to import the Aspose.Words namespace in your C# code. This namespace provides all the classes and methods required for working with Word documents.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 2: Initialize the License Object
Next, you need to initialize the License object, which will be used to set the license for Aspose.Words. Add the following code to initialize the License object:

```csharp
License license = new License();
```

## Step 3: Set the License from File
To set the license from a file, use the SetLicense method of the License object. Provide the path to your license file as the parameter. This method attempts to set the license from several locations relative to the executable and Aspose.Words.dll.

```csharp
try
{
    license.SetLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
    Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.Message);
}
```

## Step 4: Handle License Set or Error
After setting the license, you can handle the license set or error scenarios based on your requirements. In the above code snippet, we display a success message when the license is set successfully. If there's an error, we catch the exception and display an error message.

Now you have successfully applied the license from a file using Aspose.Words for .NET. You can continue with your document processing tasks using the full functionality of the library.

### Example Source Code for Apply License From File using Aspose.Words for .NET

try
{
    license.SetLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
