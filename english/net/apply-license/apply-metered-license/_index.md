In this comprehensive tutorial, you will learn how to apply a metered license using Aspose.Words for .NET. We will guide you through the process with detailed step-by-step instructions and provide the necessary C# code snippets. By the end of this guide, you will be able to apply a metered license and leverage the advanced features of Aspose.Words for your document processing needs.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Aspose.Words for .NET library installed on your system.
- Valid credentials for metered licensing. 

## Step 1: Import the Required Namespaces
To start, import the necessary namespaces in your C# code. These namespaces contain the classes and methods needed for working with Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 2: Set the Metered License Key
Next, you need to set the metered license key using the SetMeteredKey method of the Metered class. Provide your metered public and private keys as parameters to this method.

```csharp
try
{
    Metered metered = new Metered();
    metered.SetMeteredKey("*", "*");
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.Message);
}
```

## Step 3: Load and Process Documents
Now that you have set the metered license, you can load and process documents using Aspose.Words. In the following code snippet, we load a document named "Document.docx" and perform a simple operation of printing the page count.

```csharp
try
{
    Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Document.docx");
    Console.WriteLine(doc.PageCount);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.Message);
}
```
