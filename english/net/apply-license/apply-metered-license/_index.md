## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Next, you need to set the metered license key using the SetMeteredKey method of the Metered class. Provide your metered public and private keys as parameters to this method.

```csharp
try
{
    Metered metered = new Metered();
    metered.SetMeteredKey("*", "*");
}
catch (Exception e)

```csharp
try
{
    Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Document.docx");
    Console.WriteLine(doc.PageCount);
}
