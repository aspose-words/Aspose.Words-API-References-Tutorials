In this tutorial, we will explore the provided C# source code to copy styles from a source document to a target document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to transfer styles from one document to another, which can be useful when you want to apply consistent styles to multiple documents.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Creating Document Objects

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Document target = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

In this step, we create two `Document` objects: `doc` which represents the empty source document and `target` which represents the target document from which we will copy the styles.

## Step 3: Copy styles

```csharp
target. CopyStylesFromTemplate(doc);
```

In this step, we use the `CopyStylesFromTemplate` method to copy styles from the source document (`doc`) to the target document (`target`).

## Step 4: Saving the document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithStylesAndThemes.CopyStyles.docx");
```

In this last step, we save the source document with the styles copied to a file.

Now you can run source code to copy styles from a source document to a target document. This feature allows you to maintain style consistency across multiple documents, making it easier to manage the appearance and formatting of your documents.

### Sample source code for Copy Styles using Aspose.Words for .NET 

```csharp

// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; 

Document doc = new Document();
Document target = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");

target.CopyStylesFromTemplate(doc);

doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithStylesAndThemes.CopyStyles.docx");
            
        
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the copy styles feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. By using the `CopyStylesFromTemplate` method, we were able to copy styles from a source document to a target document, making it easier to keep styles consistent across multiple documents.

Copying styles is particularly useful when you want to apply preconfigured styles to multiple documents, ensuring a consistent look and formatting. This saves you time and effort by not having to recreate the same styles for each document.

Aspose.Words for .NET provides a powerful API for manipulating styles in your documents. You can use this feature to customize styles, apply themes, or simply transfer styles between different documents.
