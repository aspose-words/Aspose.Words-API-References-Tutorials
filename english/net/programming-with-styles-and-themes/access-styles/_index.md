In this tutorial, we will explore the provided C# source code for get document styles in Word using Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to get the full collection of styles present in the document.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Creating the document

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

In this step we create a new empty `Document` object.

## Step 3: Accessing the style collection

```csharp
string styleName = "";

StyleCollection styles = doc.Styles;
```

In this step, we access the document's style collection using the `Styles` property. This collection contains all the styles present in the document.

## Step 4: Browse Styles

```csharp
foreach(Style style in styles)
{
     if (styleName == "")
     {
         styleName = style.Name;
         Console.WriteLine(styleName);
     }
     else
     {
         styleName = styleName + "," + style.Name;
         Console.WriteLine(styleName);
     }
}
```

In this final step, we loop through each style in the collection using a `foreach` loop. We display the name of each style to the console, concatenating them with commas for better readability.

Now you can run the source code to access styles in a document and display their names to the console. This feature can be useful for analyzing styles in a document, performing specific operations on particular styles, or simply getting information about available styles.

### Sample source code for Access Styles using Aspose.Words for .NET 
```csharp

Document doc = new Document();

string styleName = "";

// Get styles collection from the document.
StyleCollection styles = doc.Styles;
foreach (Style style in styles)
{
	if (styleName == "")
	{
		styleName = style.Name;
		Console.WriteLine(styleName);
	}
	else
	{
		styleName = styleName + ", " + style.Name;
		Console.WriteLine(styleName);
	}
}
            
        
```
