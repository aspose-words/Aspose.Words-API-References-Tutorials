In this example, we are going to show you how to use the headings feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. Headings are used to structure and prioritize the content of a document.

## Step 1: Using a document generator

First, we'll use a document generator to add content to our document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
```

## Step 2: Customizing Heading Styles

By default, heading styles in Word can have bold and italic formatting. If we don't want these properties to be enforced, we need to explicitly set them to "false".

```csharp
builder.Font.Bold = false;
builder.Font.Italic = false;
```

## Step 3: Adding a Level 1 Title

We can add a level 1 title by specifying the appropriate paragraph style name and using the `Writeln` method to write the content of the title.

```csharp
builder.ParagraphFormat.StyleName = "Heading 1";
builder.Writeln("This is an H1 tag");
```

### Example source code for heading with Aspose.Words for .NET


```csharp
// Use a document builder to add content to the document.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();

// By default Heading styles in Word may have Bold and Italic formatting.
//If we do not want to be emphasized, set these properties explicitly to false.
builder.Font.Bold = false;
builder.Font.Italic = false;

builder.ParagraphFormat.StyleName = "Heading 1";
builder.Writeln("This is an H1 tag");
```

Congratulation ! You have now learned how to use the headings feature with Aspose.Words for .NET.
