In this tutorial, we will show you how to get a warning notification while using Aspose.Words for .NET. Warnings can be issued when setting up or saving a document. We will guide you step by step to understand and implement the code in your .NET project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following items:
- A working knowledge of the C# programming language
- The Aspose.Words library for .NET installed in your project

## Step 1: Define the document directory
Start by setting the directory path to the location of your Word document. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` in the code with the appropriate path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Upload the document and configure the warning handler
Load the document using the `Document` class. Next, create an instance of the `HandleDocumentWarnings` class to handle the warnings.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
HandleDocumentWarnings callback = new HandleDocumentWarnings();
doc. WarningCallback = callback;
```

## Step 3: Update the layout and save the document
Update the document layout by calling the `UpdatePageLayout()` method. This will trigger the warnings, if any. Then save the document.

```csharp
doc.UpdatePageLayout();
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.ReceiveWarningNotification.pdf");
```

### Sample source code for Receive Warning Notification using Aspose.Words for .NET 

```csharp

// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
// When you call UpdatePageLayout the document is rendered in memory. Any warnings that occured during rendering
// are stored until the document save and then sent to the appropriate WarningCallback.
doc.UpdatePageLayout();
HandleDocumentWarnings callback = new HandleDocumentWarnings();
doc.WarningCallback = callback;
// Even though the document was rendered previously, any save warnings are notified to the user during document save.
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.ReceiveWarningNotification.pdf");

```
