In this tutorial, we will walk you through how to do font formatting in a Word document using the Aspose.Words library for .NET. Font formatting lets you customize the appearance of text, including size, bold, color, font, underline, and more. We'll take you step-by-step to help you understand and implement the code in your .NET project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following items:
- A working knowledge of the C# programming language
- The Aspose.Words library for .NET installed in your project

## Step 1: Define the document directory
First, you need to set the directory path to the location of your Word document. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` in the code with the appropriate path.

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Create a new document and document generator
Next, we will create a new document by instantiating the `Document` class and a document builder by instantiating the `DocumentBuilder` class.

```csharp
// Create a new document
Document doc = new Document();

// Create a document generator
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 3: Configure font formatting
Now we will access the `Font` object of the document generator and configure the font formatting properties such as size, bold, color, font, underline, etc.

```csharp
// Access the font
Font font = builder.Font;

// Configure font formatting
font.Size = 16;
font. Bold = true;
font.Color = Color.Blue;
font.Name = "Arial";
font.Underline = Underline.Dash;
```

## Step 4: Add text to the document
Next, we'll use the document builder to add some formatted text to the document.

```csharp
// Add text to the document
builder.Write("Example text.");
```

## Step 5: Save the document
Finally, we'll save the document containing the font formatting.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.FontFormatting.docx");
```

### Sample source code for Font Formatting using Aspose.Words for .NET

font.Bold = true;
font.Color = Color.Blue;
font.Name = "Arial";
font.Underline = Underline.Dash;
builder.Write("Sample text.");
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.FontFormatting.docx");
```
