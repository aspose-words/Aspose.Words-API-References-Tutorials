In this tutorial, we will explore the C# source code provided for the "Recognize UTF-8 text with RTF load options" feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to specify recognition of UTF-8 encoded text when loading an RTF document.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Configuring upload options

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

RtfLoadOptions loadOptions = new RtfLoadOptions { RecognizeUtf8Text = true };
```

In this step, we configure the options for loading the RTF document. We create a new `RtfLoadOptions` object and set the `RecognizeUtf8Text` property to `true`. This allows Aspose.Words to correctly recognize and process UTF-8 encoded text when loading the document.

## Step 3: Loading the document

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "UTF-8 characters.rtf", loadOptions);
```

In this step, we load the RTF document using the `Document` method and passing the path to the RTF file to load, along with the specified load options.

## Step 4: Save the document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithRtfLoadOptions.RecognizeUtf8Text.rtf");
```

In this last step, we save the resulting document in RTF format using the `Save` method and passing the path to the output file.

Now you can run the source code to load the RTF document and correctly recognize UTF-8 encoded text. The resulting document will be saved in the specified directory with the name "WorkingWithRtfLoadOptions.RecognizeUtf8Text.rtf".


### Sample Source Code for UTF-8 Text Recognition Feature with RTF Loading Options with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp

            
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
	
RtfLoadOptions loadOptions = new RtfLoadOptions { RecognizeUtf8Text = true };

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "UTF-8 characters.rtf", loadOptions);

doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithRtfLoadOptions.RecognizeUtf8Text.rtf");
            
        
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the Utf-8 text recognition feature with RTF loading options in Aspose.Words for .NET. We learned how to correctly recognize and interpret Utf-8 characters when loading an RTF document.

This feature is essential to ensure the correct display of Utf-8 characters in your RTF documents. By configuring the appropriate loading options, Aspose.Words is able to correctly recognize and process these characters, helping to preserve the integrity and quality of the text.

Utf-8 text recognition is especially important when working with specific languages and character sets that require Utf-8 encoding support. Thanks to Aspose.Words for .NET, you can easily manipulate RTF documents containing Utf-8 characters without risk of loss or corruption.
