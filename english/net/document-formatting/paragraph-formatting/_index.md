In this tutorial, we are going to walk you through how to use the paragraph formatting in word document feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. Follow the steps below to understand the source code and apply the changes.

## Step 1: Creating and configuring the document

To begin, create a new document and an associated DocumentBuilder object. Here's how:

// Path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

## Step 2: Formatting the paragraph

We will now apply the formatting to the paragraph using the properties available in the ParagraphFormat object of the DocumentBuilder object. Here's how:

```csharp
ParagraphFormat paragraphFormat = builder.ParagraphFormat;
paragraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center;
paragraphFormat. LeftIndent = 50;
paragraphFormat. RightIndent = 50;
paragraphFormat. SpaceAfter = 25;
```

## Step 3: Saving the document

After inserting the text input form field, save the document to the desired location using the `Save` method. Make sure to provide the appropriate file path:

```csharp
builder.Writeln(
	"I'm a very nice formatted paragraph. I'm intended to demonstrate how the left and right indents affect word wrapping.");
builder.Writeln(
	"I'm another nice formatted paragraph. I'm intended to demonstrate how the space after paragraph looks like.");

doc.Save(dataDir + "DocumentFormatting.ParagraphFormatting.docx");
```
