In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you on how to work with form field properties in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We will explain the provided C# source code and show you how to implement it in your own projects.

To get started, ensure that you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. If you haven't done so, download and install the library from the official website.

## Step 1: Initializing the Document Object

First, initialize the `Document` object by providing the path to your source document containing form fields:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Form fields.docx");
```

## Step 2: Accessing a Form Field

Next, retrieve a specific form field from the document's form field collection. In this example, we access the form field at index 3:

```csharp
FormField formField = doc.Range.FormFields[3];
```

## Step 3: Working with Form Field Properties

You can manipulate various properties of the form field based on its type. In this example, we check if the form field is of type `FieldType.FieldFormTextInput` and set its `Result` property accordingly:

```csharp
if (formField.Type == FieldType.FieldFormTextInput)
    formField.Result = "My name is " + formField.Name;
```

Feel free to explore other properties and perform different operations based on your specific requirements.

## Step 4: Saving the Document

Finally, save the modified document:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ModifiedFormFields.docx");
```

That's it! You have successfully worked with form field properties in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET.
