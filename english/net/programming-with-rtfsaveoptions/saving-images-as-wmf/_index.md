In this tutorial, we will explore the C# source code provided for the "Saving images as WMF with RTF save options" feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to save document images in Windows Metafile (WMF) format when converting to RTF format.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Loading the document

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

In this step, we load the document using the `Document` method and passing the path to the DOCX file to load.

## Step 3: Configuring backup options

```csharp
RtfSaveOptions saveOptions = new RtfSaveOptions { SaveImagesAsWmf = true };
```

In this step, we configure the RTF backup options. We create a new `RtfSaveOptions` object and set the `SaveImagesAsWmf` property to `true`. This tells Aspose.Words to save the document images as WMF when converting to RTF.

## Step 4: Saving the document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithRtfSaveOptions.SavingImagesAsWmf.rtf", saveOptions);
```

In this last step, we save the resulting document in RTF format using the `Save` method and passing the path to the output file, along with the specified save options.

Now you can run source code to save document images in WMF format while converting to RTF format. The resulting document will be saved in the specified directory with the name "WorkingWithRtfSaveOptions.SavingImagesAsWmf.rtf".
