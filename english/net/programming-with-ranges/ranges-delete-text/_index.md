## Loading the Word document

The first step is to load the Word document where you want to delete text. Use the Document class to load the document from the source file. Here is an example :

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithRangesDeleteText.ModifiedDocument.docx");
```

In this example, we save the modified document as "WorkingWithRangesDeleteText.ModifiedDocument.docx".
