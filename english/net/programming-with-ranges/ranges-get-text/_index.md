In this guide, we will walk you through how to use the C# source code of Aspose.Words for .NET to extract text from a Word document.

## Understanding the Aspose.Words library

## Display of extracted text

Now that we have extracted the text from the specified range, we can display or process it as needed by your application. For example, you can display it on screen or save it to an output file. Here is an example to display the extracted text:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(text);
```

In this example, we use the WriteLine method of the Console class to display the extracted text in the console.
