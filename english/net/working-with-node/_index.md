Nodes in Aspose.Words for .NET represent the various elements of a Word document, such as paragraphs, tables, images, and more. By manipulating these nodes, developers can programmatically modify the content and formatting of a Word document. Nodes provide a hierarchical structure to the document, allowing easy navigation and manipulation of specific elements.

To work with nodes in Aspose.Words for .NET, developers can utilize the Document Object Model (DOM) provided by the library. The DOM represents the entire Word document as a tree of nodes, with the document itself being the root node. Each node has a specific node type and may contain child nodes, allowing for a deep level of customization.
