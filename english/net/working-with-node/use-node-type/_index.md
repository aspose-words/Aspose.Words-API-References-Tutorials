Here is a step by step guide to explain the C# source code below that illustrates how to use the node type functionality with Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Import the necessary references
Before you begin, make sure you have imported the necessary references to use Aspose.Words for .NET into your project. This includes importing the Aspose.Words library and adding the required namespaces to your source file.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 2: Create a new document
In this step, we will create a new document using the `Document` class.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Get Document Node Type
To get the node type of a document, we use the `NodeType` property.

```csharp
NodeType type = doc.NodeType;
```

### Sample Source Code for Using Node Type with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();

NodeType type = doc.NodeType;
```

This is a complete code example for using node type with Aspose.Words for .NET. Be sure to import the necessary references and follow the steps previously described to integrate this code into your project.
