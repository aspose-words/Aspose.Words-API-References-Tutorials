Here is a step by step guide to explain the C# source code below that illustrates how to get the parent node using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Import the necessary references
Before you begin, make sure you have imported the necessary references to use Aspose.Words for .NET into your project. This includes importing the Aspose.Words library and adding the required namespaces to your source file.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Nodes;
```

## Step 2: Create a new document
In this step, we will create a new document using the `Document` class.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Access the parent node
To get the parent node of a specific node, we need to access that node first. In this example, we are accessing the first child node of the document, which is usually a section.

```csharp
Node section = doc.FirstChild;
```

## Step 4: Check the parent node
Now that we have the specific node, we can check if its parent node matches the document itself. In this example, we compare the parent node with the document using the equality operator (`==`) and display the result.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Section parent is the document: " + (doc == section.ParentNode));
```

### Sample source code to get parent node with Aspose.Words for .NET


```csharp
Document doc = new Document();

// The section is the first child node of the document.
Node section = doc.FirstChild;

// The section's parent node is the document.
Console.WriteLine("Section parent is the document: " + (doc == section.ParentNode));
```

This is a complete code example to get the parent node of a specific node with Aspose.Words for .NET. Be sure to import the necessary references and follow the steps previously described to integrate this code into your project.

### FAQ's

#### Q: What is parent node in Node.js?

A: The parent node in Node.js refers to the next higher node in the hierarchy of an XML document. This is the node that contains the specified node.

#### Q: How to get the parent node of a specific node?

A: To get the parent node of a specific node, you can use the `parentNode` property of the node. This property returns the parent node of the current node.

#### Q: How to check if a node has a parent node?

A: To check if a node has a parent node, you can simply check if the `parentNode` property of the node is set. If set, it means the node has a parent node.

#### Q: Can we change the parent node of a node?

A: In most cases, the parent node of a node is determined by the structure of the XML document and cannot be changed directly. However, you can move a node to another node using specific methods, such as `appendChild` or `insertBefore`.

#### Q: How to browse the hierarchy of parent nodes?

A: To traverse the hierarchy of parent nodes, you can iterate from a specific node using the `parentNode` property until you reach the root node of the document.
