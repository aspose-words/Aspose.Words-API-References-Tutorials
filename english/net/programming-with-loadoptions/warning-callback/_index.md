When working with Word documents in a C# application, it can be useful to be aware of warnings issued when loading the document. With the Aspose.Words library for .NET, you can easily specify a callback function to handle warnings while loading the document using the LoadOptions load options. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through how to use Aspose.Words for .NET C# source code to load a document using a callback function for warnings using the LoadOptions load options.

## Understanding the Aspose.Words library

Before diving into the code, it's important to understand the Aspose.Words library for .NET. Aspose.Words is a powerful library to create, edit, convert and protect Word documents in different platforms including .NET. It offers many features for manipulating documents, such as inserting text, changing formatting, adding sections and much more.

## Configuring loading options

The first step is to configure the loading options for our document. Use the LoadOptions class to specify loading parameters. In our case, we need to set the WarningCallback property to an instance of DocumentLoadingWarningCallback. Here's how to do it:

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { WarningCallback = new DocumentLoadingWarningCallback() };
```

We create a new LoadOptions object and set the WarningCallback property to an instance of DocumentLoadingWarningCallback.

## Creating the callback function for warnings

Now we need to create a class that implements the IWarningCallback interface to handle warnings when loading the document. Here is sample code for the DocumentLoadingWarningCallback class:

```csharp
public class DocumentLoadingWarningCallback : IWarningCallback
{
     public void Warning(WarningInfo info)
     {
         // Handle the warning here
         Console.WriteLine($"Warning: {info.WarningType}, Description: {info.Description}");
     }
}
```

In this class, we have a Warning method which is called whenever a warning is issued while loading the document. You can customize this method to handle warnings in a way that suits you, such as saving them to a log file or displaying them in the console.

## Loading document using callback for warnings

Now that we have configured the load options and created the callback function for the warnings, we can load the document using the Document class and specify the load options. Here is an example :

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx", loadOptions);
```

In this example, we load the document "Document.docx" located in the documents directory using the specified load options.

### Example source code for loading options

  LoadOptions with "Warning Callback" functionality using Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Configure loading options with the "Warning Callback" feature
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { WarningCallback = new DocumentLoadingWarningCallback() };

// Load the document using the callback function for warnings
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx", loadOptions);
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we covered how to load a document using a callback function for warnings on load with the Aspose.Words library for .NET. By following the provided steps and using the provided C# source code, you can easily apply this functionality in your C# application. Managing warnings when loading the document allows you to be informed of any problems or warnings related to the loaded document.
