In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you on how to use Aspose.Words for .NET to set the number of columns for footnotes in a Word document. We will explain the provided C# source code and show you how to implement it in your own projects.

To get started, make sure you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. If you haven't done so, download and install the library from the official website.

## Step 1: Initializing the Document Object

First, initialize the `Document` object by providing the path to your source document:

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Setting Footnote Columns

Next, access the `FootnoteOptions` property of the document and set the `Columns` property to specify the number of columns for footnotes. In this example, we set it to 3 columns:

```csharp
doc.FootnoteOptions.Columns = 3;
```

## Step 3: Saving the Document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFootnotes.SetFootNoteColumns.docx");
```
