In this tutorial, we will explore the C# source code provided to ensure Ooxml Iso 29500_2008_Strict compliance when saving a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature ensures that the generated document complies with ISO 29500_2008_Strict specifications.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Loading the document

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

In this step, we load the document using the `Document` method and passing the path to the DOCX file to load.

## Step 3: Configuring OOXML backup options

```csharp
doc.CompatibilityOptions.OptimizeFor(MsWordVersion.Word2016);

OoxmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new OoxmlSaveOptions() { Compliance = OoxmlCompliance.Iso29500_2008_Strict };
```

In this step, we configure the OOXML save options using the `OptimizeFor` and `OoxmlSaveOptions` methods. We optimize document compatibility for Word 2016 version using `OptimizeFor` and set compliance to `Iso29500_2008_Strict` using `Compliance`.

## Step 4: Saving the document with Ooxml Iso 29500_2008_Strict compliance

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithOoxmlSaveOptions.OoxmlComplianceIso29500_2008_Strict.docx", saveOptions);
```

In this last step, we save the document using the `Save` method and passing the path to the output file with the `.docx` extension, along with the specified save options.

Now you can run source code to ensure Ooxml Iso 29500_2008_Strict compliance when saving a document. The resulting file will be saved in the specified directory with the name "WorkingWithOoxmlSaveOptions.OoxmlComplianceIso29500_2008_Strict.docx".

### Sample source code for Ooxml Compliance Iso 29500_ 2008_ Strict using Aspose.Words for .NET 
```csharp

// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; 

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");

doc.CompatibilityOptions.OptimizeFor(MsWordVersion.Word2016);

OoxmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new OoxmlSaveOptions() { Compliance = OoxmlCompliance.Iso29500_2008_Strict };

doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithOoxmlSaveOptions.OoxmlComplianceIso29500_2008_Strict.docx", saveOptions);
            
        
```
