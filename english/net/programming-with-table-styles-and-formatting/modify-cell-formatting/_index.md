In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process to change cell formatting using Aspose.Words for .NET. We'll explain the bundled C# source code and provide you with a comprehensive guide to help you understand and implement this feature in your own projects. At the end of this tutorial, you will know how to change the width, orientation and background color of a cell in a table in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Define the document directory
First, you need to set the path to your documents directory. This is where your Word document is located. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the appropriate path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load existing document
Next, you need to load the existing Word document into an instance of the `Document` class.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Tables.docx");
```

## Step 3: Go to the cell to modify
To change the formatting of a cell, we need to navigate to the specific cell in the table. We use the `GetChild()` and `FirstRow.FirstCell` methods to get the reference to the first cell of the first array.

```csharp
Table table = (Table)doc.GetChild(NodeType.Table, 0, true);
Cell firstCell = table.FirstRow.FirstCell;
```

## Step 4: Change cell formatting
Now we can change the cell formatting using the properties of the `CellFormat` class. For example, we can set the cell width, text orientation, and background color.

```csharp
firstCell.CellFormat.Width = 30;
firstCell.CellFormat.Orientation = TextOrientation.Downward;
firstCell.CellFormat.Shading.ForegroundPatternColor = Color.LightGreen;
```

### Sample source code for Modify Cell Formatting using Aspose.Words for .NET 

```csharp
	// Path to your document directory 
	string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

	Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Tables.docx");

	Cell firstCell = table.FirstRow.FirstCell;
	firstCell.CellFormat.Width = 30;
	firstCell.CellFormat.Orientation = TextOrientation.Downward;
	firstCell.CellFormat.Shading.ForegroundPatternColor = Color.LightGreen;
```
