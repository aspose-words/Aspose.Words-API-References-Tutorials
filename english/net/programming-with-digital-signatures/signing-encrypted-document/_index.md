In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to use the feature of signing an encrypted word document with Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to digitally sign a Word document that is encrypted using a decryption password. Follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Setting Signature Options

Create an instance of the SignOptions class and set the decryption password:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
SignOptions signOptions = new SignOptions { DecryptionPassword = "decryptionpassword" };
```

Be sure to specify the correct decryption password for your encrypted document.

## Step 2: Loading the certificate

Start by loading the signing certificate using the CertificateHolder class:

```csharp
CertificateHolder certHolder = CertificateHolder.Create(dataDir + "morzal.pfx", "aw");
```

Be sure to specify the correct path to your certificate and associated password.

## Step 3: Signing the encrypted document

Use the DigitalSignatureUtil class to sign the encrypted document:

```csharp
DigitalSignatureUtil.Sign(dataDir + "Digitally signed.docx", dataDir + "Document.EncryptedDocument.docx",
	certHolder, signOptions);
```

Be sure to specify the correct paths for the encrypted document, signed document, and certificate.

#### Q: What is an encrypted Word document?

A: An encrypted Word document is a document that has been encrypted using a password. Encryption is a security measure that protects the content of the document by scrambling it and making it unreadable without the correct decryption password.

#### Q: How can I sign an encrypted Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET?

A: To sign an encrypted Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET, you need to provide the decryption password along with the signing certificate. Follow these steps:
1. Set the decryption password in the `SignOptions` object.
2. Load the signing certificate using the `CertificateHolder` class.
3. Use the `DigitalSignatureUtil.Sign` method to sign the encrypted document, providing the necessary parameters.

#### Q: What is the purpose of signing an encrypted document?

A: Signing an encrypted document with Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to add a digital signature to the document even when it is encrypted.
