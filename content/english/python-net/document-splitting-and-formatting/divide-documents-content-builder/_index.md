Aspose.Words for Python provides a robust API for working with Word documents, allowing you to perform various tasks efficiently. One essential feature is dividing documents with Content Builder, which helps achieve precision and organization in your documents. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Aspose.Words for Python to divide documents using the Content Builder module.

## Introduction

When dealing with large documents, it's crucial to maintain a clear structure and organization. Dividing a document into sections can enhance readability and facilitate targeted editing. Aspose.Words for Python allows you to achieve this with its powerful Content Builder module.

## Setting Up Aspose.Words for Python

Before we dive into the implementation, let's set up Aspose.Words for Python.

1. Installation: Install the Aspose.Words library using `pip`:
   
   ```python
   pip install aspose-words
   ```

2. Importing:
   
   ```python
   import aspose.words as aw
   ```

## Creating a New Document

Let's begin by creating a new Word document using Aspose.Words for Python.

```python
# Create a new document
doc = aw.Document()
```

## Adding Content with Content Builder

The Content Builder module allows us to efficiently add content to the document. Let's add a title and some introductory text.

```python
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)

# Add a title
builder.bold()
builder.font.size = aw.units.point_to_twip(16)
builder.write("Document Precision with Content Builder\n\n")

# Add an introduction
builder.font.clear_formatting()
builder.writeln("Dividing documents is essential for maintaining precision and organization in lengthy content.")
builder.writeln("In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the Content Builder module to achieve this.")
```

## Dividing Documents for Precision

Now comes the core functionality – dividing the document into sections. We'll use Content Builder to insert section breaks.

```python
# Insert a section break
builder.insert_break(aw.BreakType.SECTION_BREAK_NEW_PAGE)
```

You can insert different types of section breaks based on your requirements, such as `SECTION_BREAK_NEW_PAGE`, `SECTION_BREAK_CONTINUOUS`, or `SECTION_BREAK_EVEN_PAGE`.

## Example Use Case: Creating a Curriculum Vitae

Let's consider a practical use case: creating a curriculum vitae (CV) with distinct sections.

```python
# Add CV sections
sections = ["Personal Information", "Education", "Work Experience", "Skills", "References"]

for section in sections:
    builder.bold()
    builder.write(section)
    builder.insert_break(aw.BreakType.SECTION_BREAK_NEW_PAGE)
```
