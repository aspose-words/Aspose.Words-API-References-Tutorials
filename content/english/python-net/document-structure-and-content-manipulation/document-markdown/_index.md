## Introduction to Aspose.Words for Python

Aspose.Words for Python is a versatile library that allows developers to manipulate Word documents programmatically. It provides an extensive set of features for creating, editing, and formatting documents, including the ability to add Markdown formatting.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into the code, let's ensure our environment is properly set up. Follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your system.
2. Install the Aspose.Words for Python library using pip:

## Loading and Creating Word Documents

To get started, import the necessary classes and create a new Word document using Aspose.Words. Here's a basic example:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

doc = aw.Document()
```

## Adding Markdown Formatted Text

Now, let's add some Markdown formatted text to our document. Aspose.Words allows you to insert paragraphs with different formatting options, including Markdown.

```python
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
markdown_text = "This is **bold** and *italic* text."
builder.writeln(markdown_text)
```

## Styling with Markdown

Markdown provides a simple way to apply styling to your text. You can combine various elements to create headers, lists, and more. Here's an example:

```python
markdown_styled_text = "# Heading 1\n\n**Bold Text**\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2"
builder.writeln(markdown_styled_text)

## Inserting Images with Markdown

Adding images to your document is also possible with Markdown. Make sure the image files are in the same directory as your script:

```python
markdown_with_image = "![Alt Text](image.png)"
builder.insert_html(markdown_with_image)
```

## Handling Tables and Lists

Tables and lists are essential parts of many documents. Markdown simplifies their creation:

```python
markdown_table = "| Header 1 | Header 2 |\n|----------|----------|\n| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |"
builder.insert_html(markdown_table)
```

section = doc.sections[0]
section.page_setup.left_margin = aw.convert_util.inch_to_point(1)
section.page_setup.right_margin = aw.convert_util.inch_to_point(1)
```
