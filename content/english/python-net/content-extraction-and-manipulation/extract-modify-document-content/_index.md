## Introduction to Aspose.Words for Python

Aspose.Words is a popular document manipulation and generation library that provides extensive capabilities for working with Word documents programmatically. Its Python API offers a wide range of functions to extract, modify, and manipulate content within Word documents.

## Installation and Setup

To begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can then install the Aspose.Words for Python library using the following command:

```python
pip install aspose-words
```

## Loading Word Documents

Loading a Word document is the first step towards working with its content. You can use the following code snippet to load a document:

```python
from asposewords import Document

doc = Document("path/to/your/document.docx")
```

## Extracting Text

To extract text from the document, you can iterate through paragraphs and runs:

```python
for para in doc.get_child_nodes(asposewords.NodeType.PARAGRAPH, True):
    text = para.get_text()
    print(text)
```

## Working with Formatting

Aspose.Words allows you to work with formatting styles:

```python
run = doc.get_first_section().get_body().get_first_paragraph().get_runs().get(0)
run.get_font().set_bold(True)
run.get_font().set_color(255, 0, 0)
```

## Replacing Text

Replacing text can be achieved using the `replace` method:

```python
doc.get_range().replace("old_text", "new_text", False, False)
```

## Adding and Modifying Images

Images can be added or replaced using the `insert_image` method:

```python
shape = doc.get_first_section().get_body().append_child(asposewords.Drawing.Shape(doc, asposewords.Drawing.ShapeType.IMAGE))
shape.get_image_data().set_source("path/to/image.jpg")
```

## Saving the Modified Document

After making modifications, save the document:

```python
doc.save("path/to/modified/document.docx")
```

## Handling Tables and Lists

Working with tables and lists involves iterating through rows and cells:

```python
for table in doc.get_child_nodes(asposewords.NodeType.TABLE, True):
    for row in table.get_rows():
        for cell in row.get_cells():
            text = cell.get_text()
```

## Dealing with Headers and Footers

Headers and footers can be accessed and modified:

```python
header = doc.get_first_section().get_headers_footers().get_by_header_footer_type(asposewords.HeaderFooterType.HEADER_PRIMARY)
header.get_paragraphs().add("Header content")
```

## Adding Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can be added using the `insert_hyperlink` method:

```python
run = doc.get_first_section().get_body().get_first_paragraph().get_runs().get(0)
run.get_font().set_color(0, 0, 255)
doc.get_hyperlinks().add(run, "https://www.example.com")
```

## Converting to Other Formats

Aspose.Words supports converting documents to various formats:

```python
doc.save("path/to/converted/document.pdf", asposewords.SaveFormat.PDF)
