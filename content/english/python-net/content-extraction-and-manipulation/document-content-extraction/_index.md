            print("Cell Text:", cell.get_text())
```

## Working with Hyperlinks

Extracting hyperlinks:

```python
for hyperlink in doc.get_child_nodes(doc.is_hyperlink, True):

    print("URL:", hyperlink.address)
```

## Extracting Headers and Footers

To extract content from headers and footers:
