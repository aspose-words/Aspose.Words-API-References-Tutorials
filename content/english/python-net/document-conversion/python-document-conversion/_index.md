## Customizing Document Conversion

### Applying Formatting and Styling

Aspose.Words allows you to customize the appearance of the converted documents. You can apply formatting options like font styles, colors, alignment, and paragraph spacing.

#### Example:

```python
# Python code for applying formatting during conversion
import aspose.words as aw

# Load the Word document
doc = aw.Document("input.docx")

# Get the first paragraph
paragraph = doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph

# Apply bold formatting to the text
run = paragraph.runs[0]
run.font.bold = True

# Save the formatted document as PDF
doc.save("formatted_output.pdf", aw.SaveFormat.PDF)
```

### Handling Images and Tables

Aspose.Words enables you to handle images and tables during the conversion process. You can extract images, resize them, and manipulate tables to maintain the document's structure.

#### Example:

```python
# Python code for handling images and tables during conversion
import aspose.words as aw

# Load the Word document
doc = aw.Document("input.docx")

# Access the first table in the document
table = doc.first_section.body.tables[0]

# Get the first image in the document
image = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True)

# Resize the image
image.width = 200
image.height = 150

# Save the modified document as PDF
doc.save("modified_output.pdf", aw.SaveFormat.PDF)
```

### Managing Fonts and Layout

With Aspose.Words, you can ensure consistent font rendering and manage the layout of the converted documents. This feature is particularly useful when maintaining document consistency across different formats.

#### Example:

```python
# Python code for managing fonts and layout during conversion
import aspose.words as aw

# Load the Word document
doc = aw.Document("input.docx")

# Set the default font for the document
doc.styles.default_font.name = "Arial"
doc.styles.default_font.size = 12

# Save the document with the modified font settings as PDF
doc.save("font_modified_output.pdf", aw.SaveFormat.PDF)
```

## Automating Document Conversion

### Writing Python Scripts for Automation

Python's scripting capabilities make it an excellent choice for automating repetitive tasks. You can write Python scripts to perform batch document conversion, saving time and effort.

#### Example:

```python
# Python script for batch document conversion
import os
import aspose.words as aw

# Set the input and output directories
input_dir = "input_documents"
output_dir = "output_documents"

# Get a list of all files in the input directory
input_files = os.listdir(input_dir)

# Loop through each file and perform the conversion
for filename in input_files:
    # Load the document
    doc = aw.Document(os.path.join(input_dir, filename))
    
    # Convert the document to PDF
    output_filename = filename.replace(".docx", ".pdf")
    doc.save(os.path.join(output_dir, output_filename), aw.SaveFormat.PDF)
```

### Batch Conversion of Documents

By

 combining the power of Python and Aspose.Words, you can automate the bulk conversion of documents, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

#### Example:

```python
# Python script for batch document conversion using Aspose.Words
import os
import aspose.words as aw

# Set the input and output directories
input_dir = "input_documents"
output_dir = "output_documents"

# Get a list of all files in the input directory
input_files = os.listdir(input_dir)

# Loop through each file and perform the conversion
for filename in input_files:
    # Get the file extension
    file_ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()

    # Load the document based on its format
    if file_ext == ".docx":
        doc = aw.Document(os.path.join(input_dir, filename))
    elif file_ext == ".pdf":
        doc = aw.Document(os.path.join(input_dir, filename))

    # Convert the document to the opposite format
    output_filename = filename.replace(file_ext, ".pdf" if file_ext == ".docx" else ".docx")
    doc.save(os.path.join(output_dir, output_filename))
```
