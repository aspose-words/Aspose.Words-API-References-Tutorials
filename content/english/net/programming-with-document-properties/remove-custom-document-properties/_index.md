To use Aspose.Words for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This sets the stage for our code to run smoothly.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document Directory

First things first, let's set up the path to our documents directory. This is where your Word file is located.

### Step 1.1: Define the Data Directory

In your C# project, define the path to your documents directory. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" with the actual path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

### Step 1.2: Load the Document

Now, let's load the document into our code. This is where Aspose.Words for .NET comes into play.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Properties.docx");
```

## Step 2: Removing Custom Document Properties

With the document loaded, it's time to remove those pesky custom properties. Here's how you do it step by step.

### Step 2.1: Access Custom Document Properties

First, access the custom document properties of the loaded document.

```csharp
var customProperties = doc.CustomDocumentProperties;
```

### Step 2.2: Remove the Specific Property

Next, remove the specific custom property by its name. In this example, we're removing "Authorized Date".

```csharp
customProperties.Remove("Authorized Date");
```

## Step 3: Saving the Document

After removing the custom property, the final step is to save the document. This ensures your changes are applied.

### Step 3.1: Define the Save Path

Define where you want to save the modified document.

```csharp
string savePath = dataDir + "ModifiedProperties.docx";
```

### Step 3.2: Save the Document

Finally, save the document with the changes.

```csharp
doc.Save(savePath);
```
