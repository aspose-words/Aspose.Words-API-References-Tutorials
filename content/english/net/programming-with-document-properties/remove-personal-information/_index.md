## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces. This sets the stage for everything we're about to do.

using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

### 1.1 Define the Path

We need to tell our program where to find the document we're working with. This is where we define the path to your documents directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

### 1.2 Load the Document

Next, we load the document into our program. This is as simple as pointing to the file we want to manipulate.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Properties.docx");
```

## Step 2: Remove Personal Information

### 2.1 Activate the Feature

Aspose.Words makes it easy to strip personal information from your document. All it takes is one line of code.

```csharp
doc.RemovePersonalInformation = true;
```

### 2.2 Save the Document

Now that we've cleaned up our document, let's save it. This ensures all our changes are applied and the document is ready to go.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "DocumentPropertiesAndVariables.RemovePersonalInformation.docx");
```
