## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to load an encrypted Word document and save it with a new password using Aspose.Words for .NET. Handling encrypted documents is essential for maintaining document security, especially when dealing with sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/words/net).

## Import Namespaces

To start, ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported into your project:

using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;

## Step 1: Load the Encrypted Document

First, you'll load the encrypted document using the `LoadOptions` class. This class allows you to specify the password required to open the document.

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Load an encrypted document with the specified password
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Encrypted.docx", new LoadOptions("password"));
```

## Step 2: Save the Document with a New Password

Next, you'll save the loaded document as an ODT file, this time setting a new password using the `OdtSaveOptions` class.

```csharp
// Save an encrypted document with a new password
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithLoadOptions.LoadAndSaveEncryptedOdt.odt", new OdtSaveOptions("newpassword"));
