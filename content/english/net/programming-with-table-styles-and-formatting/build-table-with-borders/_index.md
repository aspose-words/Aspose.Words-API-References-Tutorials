## Introduction

Creating tables with customized borders in a Word document can make your content visually appealing and well-organized. With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can easily build and format tables with precise control over borders, styles, and colors. This tutorial will guide you through the process step-by-step, ensuring you have a detailed understanding of each part of the code.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET Library: Download and install the [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) library.
2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a development environment like Visual Studio set up on your machine.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be helpful.
4. Document Directory: A directory where your input and output documents will be stored.

## Import Namespaces

To use Aspose.Words for .NET in your project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Add the following lines to the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

The first step is to load your Word document which contains the table you want to format. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Load the document from the specified directory
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Tables.docx");
```

In this step, we specify the path to the document directory and load the document using the `Document` class.

## Step 2: Access the Table

Next, you need to access the table within the document. This can be done using the `GetChild` method to fetch the table node:

```csharp
// Access the first table in the document
Table table = (Table)doc.GetChild(NodeType.Table, 0, true);
```

Here, we access the first table in the document. The `NodeType.Table` ensures we are fetching a table node, and the index `0` indicates we want the first table.

## Step 3: Clear Existing Borders

Before setting new borders, it's a good practice to clear any existing borders. This ensures that your new formatting is applied cleanly:

```csharp
// Clear any existing borders from the table
table.ClearBorders();
```

This method removes all existing borders from the table, giving you a clean slate to work with.

## Step 4: Set New Borders

Now, you can set the new borders around and inside the table. You can customize the style, width, and color of the borders as needed:

```csharp
// Set a green border around and inside the table
table.SetBorders(LineStyle.Single, 1.5, Color.Green);
```

In this step, we set the borders to a single line style, with a width of 1.5 points, and a green color.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the modified document to the specified directory. This will create a new document with the applied table formatting:

```csharp
// Save the modified document to the specified directory
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTableStylesAndFormatting.BuildTableWithBorders.docx");
```

This line saves the document with a new name, indicating that the table borders have been modified.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily create and customize table borders in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This powerful library offers extensive features for document manipulation, making it a great choice for developers working with Word documents programmatically.
