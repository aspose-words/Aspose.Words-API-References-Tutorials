## Introduction

We'll walk through how to create a table, apply custom styles, and save your document—all in a simple, conversational tone. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, this guide will have something for you. Ready to turn your boring tables into stylish, professional ones? Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, let’s make sure you have everything you need:
- Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have this powerful library installed. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Some familiarity with C# programming will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, we need to import the necessary namespaces. This step ensures that our code has access to all the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Words for .NET.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Document and DocumentBuilder

In this step, we'll initialize a new document and a `DocumentBuilder`. The `DocumentBuilder` class provides an easy way to create and format content in a Word document.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

Explanation: We’re creating a new document and a `DocumentBuilder` instance that will help us add and format content in our document.

## Step 2: Start the Table and Insert Cells

Now, let's start building our table. We'll begin by inserting cells and adding some text to them.

```csharp
Table table = builder.StartTable();
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Name");
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Value");
builder.EndRow();
builder.InsertCell();
builder.InsertCell();
builder.EndTable();
```

Explanation: Here, we use the `StartTable` method to begin our table. We then insert cells and add text ("Name" and "Value"). Finally, we end the row and the table.

## Step 3: Add and Customize Table Style

This step involves creating a custom table style and applying it to our table. Custom styles make our tables look more professional and consistent.

```csharp
TableStyle tableStyle = (TableStyle) doc.Styles.Add(StyleType.Table, "MyTableStyle1");
tableStyle.Borders.LineStyle = LineStyle.Double;
tableStyle.Borders.LineWidth = 1;
tableStyle.LeftPadding = 18;
tableStyle.RightPadding = 18;
tableStyle.TopPadding = 12;
tableStyle.BottomPadding = 12;
table.Style = tableStyle;
```

Explanation: We add a new table style named "MyTableStyle1" and customize it by setting the border style, border width, and padding. Finally, we apply this style to our table.

## Step 4: Save the Document

After styling our table, it’s time to save the document. This step ensures that our changes are stored and we can open the document to see our styled table.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTableStylesAndFormatting.CreateTableStyle.docx");
```

Explanation: We save our document to the specified directory with a descriptive filename.
