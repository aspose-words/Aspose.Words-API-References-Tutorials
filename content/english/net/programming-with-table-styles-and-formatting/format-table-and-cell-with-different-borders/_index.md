## Introduction

Have you ever tried to make your Word documents look more professional by customizing the borders of tables and cells? If not, you’re in for a treat! This tutorial will walk you through the process of formatting tables and cells with different borders using Aspose.Words for .NET. Imagine having the power to change the appearance of your tables with just a few lines of code. Intrigued? Let's dive in and explore how you can achieve this with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A basic understanding of C# programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your computer.
- Aspose.Words for .NET library. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- A valid Aspose license. You can get a free trial or a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Import Namespaces

To work with Aspose.Words for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Add the following using directives at the top of your code file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Document and DocumentBuilder

First, you need to create a new document and initialize the DocumentBuilder, which helps in building the document content. 

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Start Creating a Table

Next, use the DocumentBuilder to start creating a table and insert the first cell.

```csharp
Table table = builder.StartTable();
builder.InsertCell();
```

## Step 3: Set Table Borders

Set the borders for the entire table. This step ensures that all cells within the table have a consistent border style unless otherwise specified.

```csharp
// Set the borders for the entire table.
table.SetBorders(LineStyle.Single, 2.0, Color.Black);
```

## Step 4: Apply Cell Shading

Apply shading to the cells to make them visually distinct. In this example, we'll set the first cell's background color to red.


```csharp
// Set the cell shading for this cell.
builder.CellFormat.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = Color.Red;
builder.Writeln("Cell #1");
```

## Step 5: Insert Another Cell with Different Shading

Insert the second cell and apply a different shading color. This makes the table more colorful and easier to read.

```csharp
builder.InsertCell();
// Specify a different cell shading for the second cell.
builder.CellFormat.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = Color.Green;
builder.Writeln("Cell #2");
builder.EndRow();
```

## Step 6: Clear Cell Formatting

Clear the cell formatting from previous operations to ensure the next cells don't inherit the same styles.


```csharp
// Clear the cell formatting from previous operations.
builder.CellFormat.ClearFormatting();
```

## Step 7: Customize Borders for Specific Cells

Customize the borders for specific cells to make them stand out. Here, we’ll set larger borders for the first cell of the new row.

```csharp
builder.InsertCell();
// Create larger borders for the first cell of this row. This will be different
// compared to the borders set for the table.
builder.CellFormat.Borders.Left.LineWidth = 4.0;
builder.CellFormat.Borders.Right.LineWidth = 4.0;
builder.CellFormat.Borders.Top.LineWidth = 4.0;
builder.CellFormat.Borders.Bottom.LineWidth = 4.0;
builder.Writeln("Cell #3");
```

## Step 8: Insert Final Cell

Insert the final cell and ensure its formatting is cleared, so it uses the table's default styles.

```csharp
builder.InsertCell();
builder.CellFormat.ClearFormatting();
builder.Writeln("Cell #4");
```

## Step 9: Save the Document

Finally, save the document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTableStylesAndFormatting.FormatTableAndCellWithDifferentBorders.docx");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve just learned how to format tables and cells with different borders using Aspose.Words for .NET. By customizing table borders and cell shading, you can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your documents. So go ahead, experiment with different styles, and make your documents stand out!

## FAQ's

### Can I use different border styles for each cell?
Yes, you can set different border styles for each cell by using the `CellFormat.Borders` property.

### How can I remove all borders from a table?
You can remove all borders by setting the border style to `LineStyle.None`.

### Is it possible to set different border colors for each cell?
Absolutely! You can customize the border color for each cell using the `CellFormat.Borders.Color` property.

### Can I use images as cell backgrounds?
While Aspose.Words doesn’t directly support images as cell backgrounds, you can insert an image into a cell and adjust its size to cover the cell area.

### How do I merge cells in a table?
You can merge cells using the `CellFormat.HorizontalMerge` and `CellFormat.VerticalMerge` properties.
