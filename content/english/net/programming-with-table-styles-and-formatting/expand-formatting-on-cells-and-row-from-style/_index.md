## Introduction

Ever found yourself needing to apply consistent styling across tables in your Word documents? Manually adjusting each cell can be tedious and prone to errors. That's where Aspose.Words for .NET comes in handy. This tutorial will guide you through the process of expanding formatting on cells and rows from a table style, ensuring your documents look polished and professional without the extra hassle.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty details, make sure you have the following in place:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Visual Studio: Any recent version will work.
- Basic knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming is essential.
- Sample Document: Have a Word document with a table ready, or you can use the one provided in the code example.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let’s import the necessary namespaces. This will ensure that all the required classes and methods are available for use in our code.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

Now, let’s break down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 1: Load Your Document

In this step, we'll load the Word document that contains the table you want to format. 

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Tables.docx");
```

## Step 2: Access the Table

Next, we need to access the first table in the document. This table will be the focus of our formatting operations.

```csharp
// Get the first table in the document.
Table table = (Table) doc.GetChild(NodeType.Table, 0, true);
```

## Step 3: Retrieve the First Cell

Now, let’s retrieve the first cell of the first row in the table. This will help us demonstrate how the cell’s formatting changes when styles are expanded.

```csharp
// Get the first cell of the first row in the table.
Cell firstCell = table.FirstRow.FirstCell;
```

## Step 4: Check Initial Cell Shading

Before we apply any formatting, let’s check and print the initial shading color of the cell. This will give us a baseline to compare against after the style expansion.

```csharp
// Print the initial cell shading color.
Color cellShadingBefore = firstCell.CellFormat.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor;
Console.WriteLine("Cell shading before style expansion: " + cellShadingBefore);
```

## Step 5: Expand Table Styles

Here’s where the magic happens. We’ll call the `ExpandTableStylesToDirectFormatting` method to apply the table styles directly to the cells.

```csharp
// Expand the table styles to direct formatting.
doc.ExpandTableStylesToDirectFormatting();
```

## Step 6: Check Final Cell Shading

Finally, we’ll check and print the shading color of the cell after expanding the styles. You should see the updated formatting applied from the table style.

```csharp
// Print the cell shading color after style expansion.
Color cellShadingAfter = firstCell.CellFormat.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor;
Console.WriteLine("Cell shading after style expansion: " + cellShadingAfter);
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you can easily expand formatting on cells and rows from styles in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across your documents. Happy coding!

## FAQ's

### What is Aspose.Words for .NET?
