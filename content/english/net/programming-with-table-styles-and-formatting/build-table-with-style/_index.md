## Introduction

Creating stylish, professional documents often requires more than just plain text. Tables are a fantastic way to organize data, but making them look appealing is an entirely different challenge. Enter Aspose.Words for .NET! In this tutorial, we'll dive into how to build a table with style, making your Word documents look polished and professional.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the step-by-step guide, let’s ensure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: If you haven't already, download and install [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: You should have a development environment set up. Visual Studio is a great option for this tutorial.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along more easily.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This will give you access to the classes and methods required to manipulate Word documents.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Document and DocumentBuilder

First things first, you need to create a new document and a `DocumentBuilder` object. This `DocumentBuilder` will help you construct the table in your document.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Start Building the Table

Now that we have our document and builder ready, let's start creating the table.

```csharp
Table table = builder.StartTable();
```

## Step 3: Insert the First Row

A table without rows is just an empty structure. We need to insert at least one row before we can set any table formatting.

```csharp
builder.InsertCell();
```

## Step 4: Set the Table Style

With the first cell inserted, it's time to add some style to our table. We'll use the `StyleIdentifier` to apply a predefined style.

```csharp
// Set the table style used based on the unique style identifier
table.StyleIdentifier = StyleIdentifier.MediumShading1Accent1;
```

## Step 5: Define Style Options

The table style options define which parts of the table will be styled. For example, we can choose to style the first column, row bands, and the first row.

```csharp
// Apply which features should be formatted by the style
table.StyleOptions = TableStyleOptions.FirstColumn | TableStyleOptions.RowBands | TableStyleOptions.FirstRow;
```

## Step 6: Adjust Table to Fit Contents

To ensure our table looks neat and tidy, we can use the `AutoFit` method to adjust the table to fit its contents.

```csharp
table.AutoFit(AutoFitBehavior.AutoFitToContents);
```

## Step 7: Insert Data into the Table

Now it's time to fill our table with some data. We’ll start with the header row and then add some sample data.

### Inserting Header Row

```csharp
builder.Writeln("Item");
builder.CellFormat.RightPadding = 40;
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("Quantity (kg)");
builder.EndRow();
```

#### Inserting Data Rows

```csharp
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("Apples");
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("20");
builder.EndRow();

builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("Bananas");
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("40");
builder.EndRow();

builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("Carrots");
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("50");
builder.EndRow();
```

## Step 8: Save the Document

After inserting all the data, the final step is to save the document.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTableStylesAndFormatting.BuildTableWithStyle.docx");
```
