## Introduction

Do you ever find yourself tirelessly combing through documents to catch every little grammatical and spelling error? It's like playing a never-ending game of "Where's Waldo," isn't it? Well, worry no more! With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can automate the process and save yourself a ton of time and hassle. Let’s dive into how you can enable grammatical and spelling error displays in your Word documents using this nifty tool.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: You should be familiar with basic C# programming concepts.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This will ensure that your code can access all the features of the Aspose.Words library.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

Let’s break down the process of showing grammatical and spelling errors in your Word documents step by step. Each step will have a heading and detailed explanation.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Before we dive into the code, make sure your project is set up correctly. Open your IDE and create a new .NET project. Add a reference to the Aspose.Words library. If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).

## Step 2: Define the Document Directory

First things first, you need to define the path to your document directory. This is where your Word documents are located.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your Word documents are stored. This will help Aspose.Words locate the document you want to work on.

## Step 3: Load Your Document

Next, you need to load the document you want to process. Aspose.Words makes this incredibly simple.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

Here, `Document.docx` is the name of the file you want to check for grammatical and spelling errors. Make sure this file exists in your specified directory.

## Step 4: Enable Grammatical and Spelling Error Display

Now comes the fun part! You can enable the display of grammatical and spelling errors with just a couple of lines of code.

```csharp
doc.ShowGrammaticalErrors = true;
doc.ShowSpellingErrors = true;
```

These properties tell Aspose.Words to highlight any grammatical and spelling errors in the document, just like how Word does it.

## Step 5: Save the Modified Document

Finally, you need to save the document after enabling the error displays. This will create a new file with the changes you made.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithDocumentOptionsAndSettings.ShowGrammaticalAndSpellingErrors.docx");
```

This will save the modified document with a new name, ensuring you don’t overwrite the original file. You can now open this new file to see all the grammatical and spelling errors highlighted.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! In just a few easy steps, you’ve learned how to automate the process of displaying grammatical and spelling errors in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only saves you time but also ensures your documents are error-free and professional.
