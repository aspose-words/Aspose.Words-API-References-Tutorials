## Introduction

Hey there! Have you ever felt like your Word documents are getting a bit cluttered? You know, those unused styles and lists that just sit there, taking up space and making your document look more complex than it needs to be? Well, you're in luck! Today, we're diving into a neat little trick using Aspose.Words for .NET to clean up those unused styles and lists. It's like giving your document a nice, refreshing bath. So, grab your coffee, sit back, and let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details, let's make sure you have everything you need. Here's a quick checklist:

- Basic Knowledge of C#: You should be comfortable with C# programming.
- Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have this library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Any C# compatible IDE like Visual Studio.
- Sample Document: A Word document with some unused styles and lists to clean up.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's get our namespaces in order. You'll need to import a few essential namespaces to work with Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Cleaning;
```

## Step 1: Load Your Document

The first step is to load the document you want to clean up. You'll need to specify the path to your document directory. This is where your Word file is located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Unused styles.docx");
```

## Step 2: Check Current Styles and Lists

Before we start cleaning up, it's a good idea to see how many styles and lists are currently in your document. This will give us a baseline to compare against after the cleanup.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Count of styles before Cleanup: {doc.Styles.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($"Count of lists before Cleanup: {doc.Lists.Count}");
```

## Step 3: Define Cleanup Options

Now, it's time to define the cleanup options. In this example, we're going to remove unused styles but keep the unused lists. You can adjust these options based on your needs.

```csharp
CleanupOptions cleanupOptions = new CleanupOptions { UnusedLists = false, UnusedStyles = true };
```

## Step 4: Perform the Cleanup

With our cleanup options set, we can now clean up the document. This step will remove the unused styles and keep the unused lists intact.

```csharp
doc.Cleanup(cleanupOptions);
```

## Step 5: Check Styles and Lists After Cleanup

To see the impact of our cleanup, let's check the count of styles and lists again. This will show how many styles were removed.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Count of styles after Cleanup: {doc.Styles.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($"Count of lists after Cleanup: {doc.Lists.Count}");
```

## Step 6: Save the Cleaned Document

Finally, let's save our cleaned-up document. This will ensure all changes are saved, and your document is as tidy as possible.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "CleanedDocument.docx");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully cleaned up your Word document by removing unused styles and lists using Aspose.Words for .NET. It's like decluttering your digital desk, making your documents more manageable and efficient. Give yourself a pat on the back for a job well done!
