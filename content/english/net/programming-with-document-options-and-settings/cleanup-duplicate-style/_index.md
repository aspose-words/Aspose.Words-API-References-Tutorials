## Introduction

Hey there, coding enthusiasts! Ever found yourself tangled in a web of duplicate styles while working on a Word document? We've all been there, and it's not a pretty sight. But don't worry, Aspose.Words for .NET is here to save the day! In this tutorial, we'll dive into the nitty-gritty of cleaning up duplicate styles in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will walk you through each step with clear, easy-to-follow instructions. So, let's roll up our sleeves and get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the action, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: You don't need to be a C# wizard, but a basic understanding of the language will be helpful.
2. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
3. Development Environment: A good development environment like Visual Studio will make your life a lot easier.
4. Sample Document: Have a sample Word document (.docx) that contains duplicate styles ready for testing.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces. This step ensures that you have access to all the classes and methods you'll need.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load Your Document

To start, you need to load your Word document into your project. This is where your sample document comes into play.

1. Specify the Document Directory: Define the path to the directory where your document is stored.
2. Load the Document: Use the `Document` class to load your document.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Count the Styles Before Cleanup

Before we clean up, let's see how many styles are currently in the document. This gives us a baseline to compare against after the cleanup.

1. Access the Styles Collection: Use the `Styles` property of the `Document` class.
2. Print the Style Count: Use `Console.WriteLine` to display the number of styles.

```csharp
// Count of styles before Cleanup.
Console.WriteLine(doc.Styles.Count);
```

## Step 3: Set Up Cleanup Options

Now it's time to configure the cleanup options. This is where we tell Aspose.Words to focus on cleaning up duplicate styles.

1. Create CleanupOptions: Instantiate the `CleanupOptions` class.
2. Enable DuplicateStyle Cleanup: Set the `DuplicateStyle` property to `true`.

```csharp
// Cleans duplicate styles from the document.
CleanupOptions options = new CleanupOptions { DuplicateStyle = true };
```

## Step 4: Perform the Cleanup

With the cleanup options set, it's time to clean up those pesky duplicate styles.

Invoke the Cleanup Method: Use the `Cleanup` method of the `Document` class, passing in the cleanup options.

```csharp
doc.Cleanup(options);
```

## Step 5: Count the Styles After Cleanup

Let's see the result of our cleanup operation by counting the styles again. This will show us how many styles were removed.

Print the New Style Count: Use `Console.WriteLine` to display the updated number of styles.

```csharp
// Count of styles after Cleanup was decreased.
Console.WriteLine(doc.Styles.Count);
```

## Step 6: Save the Updated Document

Finally, save the cleaned-up document to your specified directory.

Save the Document: Use the `Save` method of the `Document` class.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithDocumentOptionsAndSettings.CleanupDuplicateStyle.docx");
```
