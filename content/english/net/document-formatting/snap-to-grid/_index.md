In this tutorial, we will walk you through how to use the Snap to Grid in word document feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. Follow the steps below to understand the source code and apply the changes.

## Step 1: Creating and configuring the document

To begin, create a new document and an associated DocumentBuilder object. Here's how:

```csharp
// Path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Grid Alignment

Now we'll apply grid alignment to a specific paragraph and the font used in the paragraph. Here's how:

```csharp
// Enable grid alignment for the paragraph
Paragraph by = doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph;
par.ParagraphFormat.SnapToGrid = true;

// Write text in the paragraph
builder.Writeln("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod" +
                 "tempor incident ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.");

// Enable grid alignment for the font used in the paragraph
par.Runs[0].Font.SnapToGrid = true;
```

## Step 3: Saving the document

After inserting the text input form field, save the document to the desired location using the `Save` method. Make sure to provide the appropriate file path:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "Paragraph.SnapToGrid.docx");
```
