## Introduction

Ever found yourself needing to secure a document with a password? You’re not alone. With the rise of digital documentation, protecting sensitive information is more important than ever. Aspose.Words for .NET offers a seamless way to encrypt your documents with passwords. Imagine it as putting a lock on your diary. Only those with the key (or password, in this case) can peek inside. Let’s dive into how you can achieve this, step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before we get our hands dirty with some code, there are a few things you'll need:
1. Aspose.Words for .NET: You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any C# IDE of your choice.
3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have it installed.
4. License: You can start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) or get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for full features.

Got everything? Great! Let’s move on to setting up our project.

## Import Namespaces

Before we begin, you’ll need to import the necessary namespaces. Think of namespaces as the toolkit you need for your DIY project.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Create a Document

First things first, let’s create a new document. This is like getting a blank sheet of paper ready.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

### Explanation

- dataDir: This variable stores the path where your document will be saved.
- Document doc = new Document(): This line initializes a new document.
- DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc): The DocumentBuilder is a handy tool for adding content to your document.

## Step 2: Add Content

Now that we have our blank sheet, let’s write something on it. How about a simple “Hello world!”? Classic.

```csharp
builder.Write("Hello world!");
```

### Explanation

- builder.Write("Hello world!"): This line adds the text "Hello world!" to your document.

## Step 3: Configure Save Options

Here comes the crucial part—configuring the save options to include password protection. This is where you decide the strength of your lock.

```csharp
DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions { Password = "password" };
```

### Explanation

- DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions: Initializes a new instance of the DocSaveOptions class.
- Password = "password": Sets the password for the document. Replace "password" with your desired password.

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, let’s save our document with the specified options. This is like storing your locked diary in a safe place.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithDocSaveOptions.EncryptDocumentWithPassword.docx", saveOptions);
```

### Explanation

- doc.Save: Saves the document to the specified path with the defined save options.
- dataDir + "WorkingWithDocSaveOptions.EncryptDocumentWithPassword.docx": Constructs the full path and file name for the document.
