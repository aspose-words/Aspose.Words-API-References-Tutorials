## Introduction

Hey there, fellow developers! Have you ever worked with Word documents and found yourself tangled up in the intricacies of saving picture bullets? It's one of those tiny details that can make a big difference in the final look of your document. Well, today, I'm here to guide you through the process of handling picture bullets in Aspose.Words for .NET, particularly focusing on the "Do Not Save Picture Bullet" feature. Ready to dive in? Let's go!

## Prerequisites

Before we start tinkering with the code, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have this powerful library installed. If you haven't got it yet, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: A working .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Some familiarity with C# programming will be helpful.
4. Sample Document: A Word document with image bullets for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

To kick things off, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This is pretty straightforward but crucial for accessing the Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Let's break down the process into manageable steps. This way, you can follow along easily and understand each part of the code.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, you need to specify the path to your documents directory. This is where your Word documents are stored and where you'll save the modified files.

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your system where your documents are located.

## Step 2: Load the Document with Image Bullets

Next, you'll load the Word document that contains image bullets. This document will be modified to remove the picture bullets when saved.

```csharp
// Load the document with image bullets
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Image bullet points.docx");
```

Ensure that the file `"Image bullet points.docx"` exists in the specified directory.

## Step 3: Configure Save Options

Now, let's configure the save options to specify that picture bullets should not be saved. This is where the magic happens!

```csharp
// Configure save options with the "Do Not Save Picture Bullet" feature
DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions { SavePictureBullet = false };
```

By setting `SavePictureBullet` to `false`, you instruct Aspose.Words not to save picture bullets in the output document.

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, save the document with the specified options. This will generate a new file where the picture bullets are not included.

```csharp
// Save the document with the specified options
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithDocSaveOptions.DoNotSavePictureBullet.docx", saveOptions);
```

The new file, `"WorkingWithDocSaveOptions.DoNotSavePictureBullet.docx"`, will be saved in your documents directory.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! With just a few lines of code, you've successfully configured Aspose.Words for .NET to omit picture bullets when saving a document. This can be incredibly useful when you need a clean, consistent look without the distraction of image bullets.
