In this tutorial, we'll dive into how you can achieve this. Ready to make your Word document fonts web-friendly? Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the coding, let's make sure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it from the [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) page.
- .NET Development Environment: Any IDE like Visual Studio will work perfectly.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: You don't need to be a pro, but a basic understanding will help.

## Import Namespaces

To use Aspose.Words for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code. This makes all the classes and methods available for use.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First things first, let's set up your project and install the Aspose.Words library.

### 1.1 Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App project. Name it something meaningful like "ExportFontsBase64".

### 1.2 Install Aspose.Words

You can install Aspose.Words for .NET via NuGet Package Manager:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. Search for "Aspose.Words" and install it.

Alternatively, you can run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```sh
Install-Package Aspose.Words
```

## Step 2: Load Your Word Document

Now that your project is set up, let's load the Word document you want to export fonts from.

### 2.1 Define the Document Directory

First, define the directory where your Word document is located:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your document directory.

### 2.2 Load the Document

Next, load your document using the `Document` class:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

Ensure that "Rendering.docx" is in your specified directory.

## Step 3: Configure HTML Save Options

To export fonts as Base64, we need to configure the `HtmlSaveOptions`.


Create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` and set the `ExportFontsAsBase64` property to `true`:

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions { ExportFontsAsBase64 = true };
```

## Step 4: Save the Document as HTML

Finally, let's save the document with the configured options.


Use the `Save` method of the `Document` class to save your document:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlSaveOptions.ExportFontsAsBase64.html", saveOptions);
```

This line will save your document as an HTML file with fonts exported as Base64, ensuring they are embedded within the HTML.

Congratulations! You've successfully exported fonts as Base64 from a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This ensures that your fonts are preserved and displayed correctly across different platforms. Whether you're preparing documents for web display or simply ensuring compatibility, this feature is incredibly useful.
