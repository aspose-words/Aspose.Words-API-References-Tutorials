## Introduction

So, you’re diving into the world of Aspose.Words for .NET? Awesome choice! If you’re looking to learn how to export a text input form field as text, you’re in the right place. Whether you’re just starting out or brushing up on your skills, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know. Let's get started, shall we?

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's make sure you have everything you need to follow along smoothly:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install the latest version from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- IDE: Visual Studio or any C# development environment.
- Basic C# Knowledge: Understanding of basic C# syntax and object-oriented programming concepts.
- Document: A sample Word document (`Rendering.docx`) with text input form fields.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces. These are like the building blocks that make everything work seamlessly.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Alright, now that we have our namespaces ready, let's jump into the action!

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

Before we get into the code, let's make sure our project is set up correctly.

## Creating the Project

1. Open Visual Studio: Start by opening Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
2. Create a New Project: Navigate to `File > New > Project`. Select `Console App (.NET Core)` or any other relevant project type.
3. Name Your Project: Give your project a meaningful name, something like `AsposeWordsExportExample`.

## Adding Aspose.Words

1. Manage NuGet Packages: Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select `Manage NuGet Packages`.
2. Search for Aspose.Words: In the NuGet Package Manager, search for `Aspose.Words`.
3. Install Aspose.Words: Click on `Install` to add the Aspose.Words library to your project.

## Step 2: Load the Word Document

Now that our project is set up, let's load the Word document that contains the text input form fields.

1. Specify the Document Directory: Define the path to the directory where your document is stored.
2. Load the Document: Use the `Document` class to load your Word document.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 3: Prepare the Export Directory

Before we export, let's ensure that our export directory is ready. This is where our HTML file and images will be saved.

1. Define the Export Directory: Specify the path where the exported files will be saved.
2. Check and Clean the Directory: Make sure the directory exists and is empty.

```csharp
string imagesDir = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Images");

if (Directory.Exists(imagesDir))
    Directory.Delete(imagesDir, true);

Directory.CreateDirectory(imagesDir);
```

## Step 4: Configure Save Options

Here's where the magic happens. We need to set up our save options to export the text input form field as plain text.

1. Create Save Options: Initialize a new `HtmlSaveOptions` object.
2. Set Export Text Option: Configure the `ExportTextInputFormFieldAsText` property to `true`.
3. Set Images Folder: Define the folder where images will be saved.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Html)
{
    ExportTextInputFormFieldAsText = true,
    ImagesFolder = imagesDir
};
```

## Step 5: Save the Document as HTML

Finally, let's save the Word document as an HTML file using our configured save options.

1. Define the Output Path: Specify the path where the HTML file will be saved.
2. Save the Document: Use the `Save` method of the `Document` class to export the document.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ExportedDocument.html", saveOptions);
```
