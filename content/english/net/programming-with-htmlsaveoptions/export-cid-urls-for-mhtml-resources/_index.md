## Introduction

Are you ready to master the art of exporting Cid URLs for MHTML resources using Aspose.Words for .NET? Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this comprehensive guide will walk you through every step. By the end of this article, you'll have a crystal-clear understanding of how to efficiently handle MHTML resources in your Word documents. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, let's ensure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the latest version of Aspose.Words for .NET installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: A development environment such as Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: While I'll guide you through every step, a basic understanding of C# will be beneficial.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces. This step sets the stage for our tutorial:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Now, let's break down the process into simple, manageable steps. Each step will include a detailed explanation to ensure you can follow along effortlessly.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

### Step 1.1: Create a New Project
Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. Choose the Console App template to keep things simple.

### Step 1.2: Add Aspose.Words for .NET Reference
To use Aspose.Words for .NET, you need to add a reference to the Aspose.Words library. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. Search for "Aspose.Words" and install it.

## Step 2: Loading the Word Document

### Step 2.1: Specify the Document Directory
Define the path to your document directory. This is where your Word document is located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your directory.

### Step 2.2: Load the Document
Load your Word document into the project.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Content-ID.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configuring HTML Save Options

Create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` to customize how your document will be saved as MHTML.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Mhtml)
{
    PrettyFormat = true,
    ExportCidUrlsForMhtmlResources = true
};
```

- `SaveFormat.Mhtml` specifies that the output format is MHTML.
- `PrettyFormat = true` ensures the output is neatly formatted.
- `ExportCidUrlsForMhtmlResources = true` enables the export of Cid URLs for MHTML resources.

### Step 4: Saving the Document as MHTML

Step 4.1: Save the Document
Save your document as an MHTML file using the configured options.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlSaveOptions.ExportCidUrlsForMhtmlResources.mhtml", saveOptions);
```

This tutorial walked you through setting up your project, loading a Word document, configuring HTML save options, and saving the document as MHTML. Now you can apply these steps to your own projects and enhance your document management tasks.
