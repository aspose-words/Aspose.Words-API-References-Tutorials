## Introduction

If you’re working with Word documents and need to manage footnotes and endnotes effectively, Aspose.Words for .NET is your go-to library. This tutorial will walk you through setting footnote and endnote positions in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We’ll break down each step to make it easy to follow and implement.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Visual Studio: Any recent version will work fine.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics will help you follow along easily.

## Import Namespaces

First, import the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Load the Word Document

To start, you need to load your Word document into the Aspose.Words Document object. This will allow you to manipulate the document’s contents.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

In this code, replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your document is located.

## Step 2: Set Footnote Position

Next, you’ll set the position of the footnotes. Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to position footnotes either at the bottom of the page or beneath the text.

```csharp
doc.FootnoteOptions.Position = FootnotePosition.BeneathText;
```

Here, we’ve set the footnotes to appear beneath the text. If you prefer them at the bottom of the page, use `FootnotePosition.BottomOfPage`.

## Step 3: Set Endnote Position

Similarly, you can set the position of endnotes. Endnotes can be positioned either at the end of the section or at the end of the document.

```csharp
doc.EndnoteOptions.Position = EndnotePosition.EndOfSection;
```

In this example, endnotes are placed at the end of each section. To place them at the end of the document, use `EndnotePosition.EndOfDocument`.

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, save the document to apply the changes. Ensure you specify the correct file path and name for the output document.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFootnotes.SetFootnoteAndEndNotePosition.docx");
```

This line saves the modified document to your specified directory.

Setting footnote and endnote positions in Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET is straightforward once you know the steps. By following this guide, you can customize your documents to suit your needs, ensuring that footnotes and endnotes are positioned exactly where you want them.
