## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your Word documents by efficiently managing endnotes? Look no further! In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of setting endnote options in Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll be a pro at customizing endnotes to fit your document's needs.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Have a development environment set up, such as Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: A fundamental understanding of C# programming will be beneficial.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods required for manipulating Word documents.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Notes;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, let's load the document where we want to set the endnote options. We'll use the `Document` class from the Aspose.Words library to accomplish this.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Initialize DocumentBuilder

Next, we'll initialize the `DocumentBuilder` class. This class provides a simple way to add content to the document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 3: Add Text and Insert Endnote

Now, let's add some text to the document and insert an endnote. The `InsertFootnote` method of the `DocumentBuilder` class allows us to add endnotes to the document.

```csharp
builder.Write("Some text");
builder.InsertFootnote(FootnoteType.Endnote, "Footnote text.");
```

## Step 4: Access and Set Endnote Options

To customize the endnote options, we need to access the `EndnoteOptions` property of the `Document` class. We can then set various options such as the restart rule and position.

```csharp
EndnoteOptions option = doc.EndnoteOptions;
option.RestartRule = FootnoteNumberingRule.RestartPage;
option.Position = EndnotePosition.EndOfSection;
```

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, let's save the document with the updated endnote options. The `Save` method of the `Document` class allows us to save the document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFootnotes.SetEndnoteOptions.docx");
```

## Conclusion

Setting endnote options in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET is a breeze with these simple steps. By customizing the restart rule and position of endnotes, you can tailor your documents to meet specific requirements. With Aspose.Words, the power to manipulate Word documents is at your fingertips.
