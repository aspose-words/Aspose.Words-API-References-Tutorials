## Verify Encrypted Word Document Using Aspose.Words for .NET

 Ever stumbled upon an encrypted Word document and wondered how to verify its encryption status programmatically? Well, you're in luck! Today, we're diving into a nifty little tutorial on how to do just that using Aspose.Words for .NET. This step-by-step guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from setting up your environment to running the code. So, let's get started, shall we?

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything you need. Here's a quick checklist:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET installed on your machine.
- IDE: An Integrated Development Environment like Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics of C# will help you follow along more easily.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Here's the required code snippet:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Define the document directory

To start, you need to define the path to the directory where your documents are located. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your documents directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Detect file format

Next, we use the `DetectFileFormat` method of the `FileFormatUtil` class to detect the file format information. In this example, we assume that the encrypted document is called "Encrypted.docx" and is located in the specified documents directory.

```csharp
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(dataDir + "Encrypted.docx");
```

## Step 3: Check if the document is encrypted

We use the `IsEncrypted` property of the `FileFormatInfo` object to check if the document is encrypted. This property returns `true` if the document is encrypted, otherwise it returns `false`. We display the result in the console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(info.IsEncrypted);
```

That's all ! You have successfully checked if a document is encrypted using Aspose.Words for .NET.

And there you have it! You've successfully verified the encryption status of a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. Isn't it amazing how a few lines of code can make our lives so much easier?
