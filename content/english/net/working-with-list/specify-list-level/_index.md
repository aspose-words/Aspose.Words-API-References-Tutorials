## Introduction

Hey there, fellow coder! If you’ve ever wrestled with creating dynamic and sophisticated lists in Word documents using .NET, you’re in for a treat. Today, we’re diving into the world of Aspose.Words for .NET. Specifically, we’ll be focusing on specifying list levels. Think of it as leveling up your document game, allowing you to create professional, polished lists effortlessly. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a clear path to creating both numbered and bulleted lists with multiple levels. Ready? Let’s jump right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s make sure we have everything we need. Here's a quick checklist:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio will make your life easier.
3. .NET Framework: Ensure that you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.
4. Basic Understanding of C#: This tutorial assumes you're comfortable with basic C# programming.

Got everything? Great! Let’s get our hands dirty.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, we need to import the necessary namespaces. Open your C# project and add the following using directives:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Lists;
```

This sets the stage for working with Aspose.Words in your project.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document and DocumentBuilder

Let's start by creating a new document and a `DocumentBuilder` object to work with it.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Creating a Numbered List

Now, we'll create a numbered list based on one of the Microsoft Word list templates and apply it to the `DocumentBuilder`'s current paragraph.

```csharp
builder.ListFormat.List = doc.Lists.Add(ListTemplate.NumberArabicDot);
```

## Step 3: Applying Multiple List Levels

Aspose.Words allows you to specify up to nine levels for a list. Let’s apply all of them to see how it works.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
{
    builder.ListFormat.ListLevelNumber = i;
    builder.Writeln("Level " + i);
}
```

In this loop, we’re setting the list level for each paragraph and writing a line of text that indicates the level.

## Step 4: Creating a Bulleted List

Next, let’s switch gears and create a bulleted list. This time, we’ll use a different list template.

```csharp
builder.ListFormat.List = doc.Lists.Add(ListTemplate.BulletDiamonds);
```

## Step 5: Applying Multiple Levels to the Bulleted List

Just like with the numbered list, we’ll apply multiple levels to our bulleted list.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
{
    builder.ListFormat.ListLevelNumber = i;
    builder.Writeln("Level " + i);
}
```

## Step 6: Stopping List Formatting

Finally, let's see how we can stop the list formatting to return to normal text.

```csharp
builder.ListFormat.List = null;
```

## Step 7: Saving the Document

After all that hard work, it's time to save our document. Let’s save it with a meaningful name.

```csharp
builder.Document.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithList.SpecifyListLevel.docx");
```

And that’s it! You've just created a document with complex list structures using Aspose.Words for .NET.
