## Introduction

Ever found yourself tangled in the web of CSS rules scattered all over the place when converting Word documents to HTML? Fret not! Today, we're diving into a neat feature of Aspose.Words for .NET that lets you write all CSS rules in a single file. This not only tidies up your code but also makes your life a whole lot easier. Buckle up, and let’s get started on this journey to cleaner, more efficient HTML output!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's get our ducks in a row. Here’s what you need to get started:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library. If you don’t have it yet, you can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: You’ll need a .NET development environment set up on your machine. Visual Studio is a popular choice.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A basic understanding of C# programming will be helpful.
4. A Word Document: Have a Word document (.docx) ready that you want to convert.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let’s import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. This will allow us to access the Aspose.Words functionalities easily.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Alright, let’s break down the process into easy-to-follow steps. Each step will guide you through a specific part of the process to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First, we need to define the path to your document directory. This is where your Word document is stored and where the converted HTML will be saved.

```csharp
// Access path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the Word Document

Next, we load the Word document that you want to convert into HTML. This is done using the `Document` class from the Aspose.Words library.

```csharp
// Load the Word document
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configure HTML Save Options

Now, we need to configure the HTML save options. Specifically, we want to enable the feature that writes all CSS rules into a single file. This is achieved by setting the `SaveFontFaceCssSeparately` property to `false`.

```csharp
// Configure backup options with "Write all CSS rules in one file" feature
HtmlFixedSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlFixedSaveOptions 
{ 
    SaveFontFaceCssSeparately = false 
};
```

## Step 4: Convert Document to Fixed HTML

Finally, we save the document as an HTML file using the configured save options. This step ensures that all CSS rules are written in a single file.

```csharp
// Convert document to fixed HTML
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlFixedSaveOptions.WriteAllCssRulesInSingleFile.html", saveOptions);
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! With just a few lines of code, you've successfully converted your Word document to HTML with all CSS rules neatly organized in a single file. This method not only simplifies your CSS management but also enhances the maintainability of your HTML documents. So, the next time you’re tasked with converting a Word document, you know exactly how to keep things tidy!
