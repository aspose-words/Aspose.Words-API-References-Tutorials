## Introduction

Are you ready to dive into the fascinating world of Aspose.Words for .NET? Buckle up, because we're about to take you on a journey through the magical realm of fonts. Today, we're focusing on how to use fonts from the target machine when working with Word documents. This nifty feature ensures that your document looks exactly the way you intend, regardless of where it's viewed. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty details, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. If you haven't already, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: You should have a .NET development environment set up, such as Visual Studio.
3. Document to Work With: Have a Word document ready for testing. We'll be using a document named "Bullet points with alternative font.docx".

Now that we've covered the basics, let's dive into the code!

## Import Namespaces

First things first, we need to import the necessary namespaces. This is the backbone of our project, connecting all the dots.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load the Word Document

The first step in our tutorial is to load the Word document. This is where it all begins. We'll use the `Document` class from the Aspose.Words library to achieve this.

### Step 1.1: Define the Document Path

Let's start by defining the path to your documents directory. This is where your Word document is located.

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

### Step 1.2: Load the Document

Now, we load the document using the `Document` class.

```csharp
// Load the Word document
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Bullet points with alternative font.docx");
```

## Step 2: Configure Save Options

Next, we need to configure the save options. This step is crucial as it ensures that the fonts used in your document are those from the target machine.

We'll create an instance of `HtmlFixedSaveOptions` and set the `UseTargetMachineFonts` property to `true`.

```csharp
// Configure backup options with the "Use fonts from target machine" feature
HtmlFixedSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlFixedSaveOptions
{
    UseTargetMachineFonts = true
};
```

## Step 3: Save the Document

Finally, we save the document as a fixed HTML file. This is where the magic happens!

We'll use the `Save` method to save the document with the configured save options.

```csharp
// Convert document to fixed HTML
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlFixedSaveOptions.UseFontFromTargetMachine.html", saveOptions);
```

## Step 4: Verify the Output

Last but not least, it's always a good idea to verify the output. Open the saved HTML file and check if the fonts are correctly applied from the target machine.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the HTML file and open it in a web browser.

```csharp
// Verify the output by opening the HTML file
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlFixedSaveOptions.UseFontFromTargetMachine.html");
```

And there you have it! You've successfully used fonts from the target machine in your Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Conclusion

Using fonts from the target machine ensures that your Word documents look consistent and professional, no matter where they're viewed. Aspose.Words for .NET makes this process straightforward and efficient. By following this tutorial, you've learned how to load a document, configure save options, and save the document with the desired font settings. Happy coding!
