## Introduction

we're diving into an exciting tutorial on how to work with HTML load options in Aspose.Words for .NET, specifically focusing on setting the preferred control type when inserting a combo box form field into a Word document. This step-by-step guide will help you understand how to effectively manipulate and render HTML content within your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: You should have a development environment set up, like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A fundamental understanding of C# programming is necessary to follow along with the tutorial.
4. HTML Content: Basic knowledge of HTML is helpful since we’ll be working with HTML content in this example.

## Import Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces to get started:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Loading;
```

Now, let’s break down the example into multiple steps to ensure clarity and understanding.

## Step 1: Set Up Your HTML Content

First, we need to define the HTML content that we want to insert into the Word document. Here’s the HTML snippet we'll be using:

```csharp
const string html = @"
    <html>
        <select name='ComboBox' size='1'>
            <option value='val1'>item1</option>
            <option value='val2'></option>                        
        </select>
    </html>
";
```

This HTML contains a simple combo box with two options. We will load this HTML into a Word document and specify how it should be rendered.

## Step 2: Define the Document Directory

Next, specify the directory where your Word document will be saved. This helps in organizing your files and keeping the path management clean.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where you want to save your Word document.

## Step 3: Configure HTML Load Options

Here, we configure the HTML load options, particularly focusing on the `PreferredControlType` property. This determines how the combo box should be rendered in the Word document.

```csharp
HtmlLoadOptions loadOptions = new HtmlLoadOptions { PreferredControlType = HtmlControlType.StructuredDocumentTag };
```

By setting `PreferredControlType` to `HtmlControlType.StructuredDocumentTag`, we ensure that the combo box is rendered as a structured document tag (SDT) in the Word document.

## Step 4: Load the HTML Content into the Document

Using the configured load options, we load the HTML content into a new Word document.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(html)), loadOptions);
```

Here, we convert the HTML string to a byte array and load it into the document using a memory stream. This ensures that the HTML content is correctly interpreted and rendered by Aspose.Words.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the document to the specified directory in DOCX format.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlLoadOptions.PreferredControlType.docx", SaveFormat.Docx);
```

This saves the Word document with the rendered combo box control at the specified location.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! We've successfully inserted a combo box form field into a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET by leveraging HTML load options. This step-by-step guide should help you understand the process and apply it to your projects. Whether you're automating document creation or manipulating HTML content, Aspose.Words for .NET provides powerful tools to achieve your goals.
