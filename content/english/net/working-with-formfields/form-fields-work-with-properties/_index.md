## Import Namespaces

To use Aspose.Words in your project, you’ll need to import the necessary namespaces. Here’s how:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fields;
```

Let's break down the process of working with form fields into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

First things first, you need to set up your .NET project and install Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Step 1.1: Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App (.NET Core) project. Name it something meaningful like "FormFieldsExample".

### Step 1.2: Install Aspose.Words for .NET

You can install Aspose.Words via NuGet Package Manager. Go to `Tools` -> `NuGet Package Manager` -> `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution`, and search for "Aspose.Words". Install the package.

Alternatively, you can use the NuGet Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Words
```

## Step 2: Load the Word Document

Now that your project is set up, let’s load the Word document containing the form fields.

### Step 2.1: Specify the Document Directory

Set the path to your document directory. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your document is stored.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

### Step 2.2: Load the Document

Load your Word document into the Aspose.Words Document object.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Form fields.docx");
```

## Step 3: Access and Modify Form Fields

In this step, we’ll access a specific form field and modify its properties.

### Step 3.1: Access the Form Field

Access the form field you want to modify. In this example, we’re accessing the fourth form field in the document’s range.

```csharp
FormField formField = doc.Range.FormFields[3];
```

### Step 3.2: Check the Form Field Type

Ensure that the form field is of the type `FieldFormTextInput` before modifying it.

```csharp
if (formField.Type == FieldType.FieldFormTextInput)
{
    formField.Result = "My name is " + formField.Name;
}
```

## Step 4: Save the Modified Document

After making the necessary modifications, save the document.

Save the modified document to your specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ModifiedFormFields.docx");
```
