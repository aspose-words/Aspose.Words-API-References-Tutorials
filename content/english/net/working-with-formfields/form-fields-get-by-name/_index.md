## Import Namespaces

First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Here’s how you do it:

```csharp

using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fields;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Before jumping into the code, you need to set up your project. Here’s how:

### 1.1 Create a New Project

Open your development environment and create a new C# project. Name it something relevant, like "AsposeFormFieldsExample."

### 1.2 Add Aspose.Words for .NET Library

Add the Aspose.Words for .NET library to your project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager by running the following command:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Words

## Step 2: Load the Document

Now, let’s load the Word document that contains the form fields. We’ll start by defining the path to your document directory and then loading the document.

### 2.1 Define the Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

### 2.2 Load the Document

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Form fields.docx");
```

## Step 3: Access Form Fields

Next, we’ll access the form fields in the document. Here’s how:

### 3.1 Get the Collection of Form Fields

```csharp
FormFieldCollection documentFormFields = doc.Range.FormFields;
```

### 3.2 Retrieve Specific Form Fields by Index and Name

```csharp
FormField formField1 = documentFormFields[3];
FormField formField2 = documentFormFields["Text2"];
```

## Step 4: Modify Form Fields

Now that we have access to the form fields, let’s modify them. This is where the magic happens!

### 4.1 Change Font Size of FormField1

```csharp
formField1.Font.Size = 20;
```

### 4.2 Change Font Color of FormField2

```csharp
formField2.Font.Color = Color.Red;
```

## Step 5: Save the Modified Document

Finally, let’s save the modified document with a new name to preserve the original file.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ModifiedFormFields.docx");
```
