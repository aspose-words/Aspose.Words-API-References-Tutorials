Splitting a Word document by headings can be a game-changer for managing large documents or creating segmented HTML outputs. Aspose.Words for .NET provides a straightforward way to achieve this. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the entire process, ensuring you grasp every detail along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: If you haven't already, download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics will help you follow along easily.
4. A Sample Document: Have a Word document ready that you want to split by headings.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let’s import the necessary namespaces. This is crucial for accessing the Aspose.Words classes and methods.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

To get started, set up your project in your development environment. Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application.

1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio, select 'Create a new project', choose 'Console App (.NET Core)', and click 'Next'.
2. Configure Your Project: Name your project, choose a location to save it, and click 'Create'.
3. Install Aspose.Words for .NET: Use NuGet Package Manager to install the Aspose.Words library. In the NuGet Package Manager, search for `Aspose.Words` and install it.

## Step 2: Load Your Document

Next, you need to load the Word document you want to split. Make sure your document is placed in a directory you can easily access.

1. Define the Directory Path: Create a variable for your document's directory path.
2. Load the Document: Use the `Document` class to load your Word document.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configure HTML Save Options

Now, let’s configure the HTML save options to specify that the document should be split by headings.

1. Create HtmlSaveOptions: Instantiate the `HtmlSaveOptions` class.
2. Set Document Split Criteria: Use the `DocumentSplitCriteria` property to specify that the document should be split by heading paragraphs.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions
{
    // Split a document into smaller parts, in this instance split by heading.
    DocumentSplitCriteria = DocumentSplitCriteria.HeadingParagraph
};
```

## Step 4: Save the Split Document

Finally, save the document with the specified HTML save options. This will generate an HTML file split by headings.

1. Save the Document: Use the `Save` method of the `Document` class to save the document with the specified options.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "SplitDocument.ByHeadingsHtml.html", options);
```
