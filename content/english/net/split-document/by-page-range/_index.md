## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself needing just a few pages from a hefty Word document? Maybe you need to share a specific section with a colleague or extract a chapter for a report. Whatever the case, splitting a Word document by page range can be a lifesaver. With Aspose.Words for .NET, this task becomes a breeze. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to split a Word document by a specific page range using Aspose.Words for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this step-by-step tutorial will make it easy to achieve your goal.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: You need to have Aspose.Words for .NET installed. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: A suitable development environment such as Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: While we'll walk you through each step, a basic understanding of C# will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

Before you start coding, ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First, you'll need to set up your project in your development environment. Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project. Name it something relevant, like "SplitWordDocument".

## Step 2: Add Aspose.Words for .NET

To use Aspose.Words, you need to add it to your project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. Search for "Aspose.Words" and install it.

## Step 3: Load Your Document

Now, let's load the document you want to split. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the path to your document:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Big document.docx");
```

## Step 4: Extract the Desired Pages

With the document loaded, it's time to extract the pages you need. In this example, we're extracting pages 3 to 6:

```csharp
Document extractedPages = doc.ExtractPages(3, 6);
```

## Step 5: Save the Extracted Pages

Finally, save the extracted pages as a new document:

```csharp
extractedPages.Save(dataDir + "SplitDocument.ByPageRange.docx");
```
