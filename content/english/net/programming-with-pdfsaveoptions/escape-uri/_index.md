## Introduction

Hey there! Ever wondered how to handle URIs when saving a Word document as a PDF using Aspose.Words for .NET? You're in the right place! Today, we'll dive deep into escaping URIs in PDF documents to ensure they function correctly when your document is converted. Let's embark on this journey together, step-by-step, ensuring you grasp each concept along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have the latest version. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This is crucial for accessing Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Alright, let's break down the process into digestible steps. Follow along and you'll be a pro at escaping URIs in no time!

## Step 1: Setup Your Document Directory

Before diving into the code, set up the path to your documents directory. This is where your files will be saved.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where you want to save your PDF document.

## Step 2: Create a New Document

Next, we'll create a new document using Aspose.Words. This document will serve as our canvas for inserting hyperlinks.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

Here, `Document` is your new Word document, and `DocumentBuilder` is a helper class that simplifies the document creation process.

## Step 3: Insert a Hyperlink

Now, let's insert a hyperlink into the document. This hyperlink will be the focus of our URI escaping process.

```csharp
builder.InsertHyperlink("Testlink", "https://www.google.com/search?q= aspose", false);
```

In this line, `"Testlink"` is the display text for the hyperlink, and `"https://www.google.com/search?q= aspose"` is the URL. The `false` parameter indicates that the link should not be formatted as a hyperlink (i.e., it won't be underlined and blue).

## Step 4: Save the Document as a PDF

Finally, save the document as a PDF. This is where Aspose.Words takes care of escaping the URI in the PDF output.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.EscapeUri.pdf");
```

This line saves the document to the specified directory with the filename `WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.EscapeUri.pdf`.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve just learned how to escape URIs when saving a Word document as a PDF using Aspose.Words for .NET. This process ensures that your hyperlinks remain functional and properly formatted in the resulting PDF. 

Remember, mastering these small yet significant techniques can greatly enhance the quality and functionality of your documents. Happy coding!
