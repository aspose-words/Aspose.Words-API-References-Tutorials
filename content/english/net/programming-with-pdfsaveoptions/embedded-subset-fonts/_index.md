## Introduction

Have you ever noticed how some PDF files are much larger than others, even when they contain similar content? The culprit often lies in the fonts. Embedding fonts in a PDF ensures that it looks the same on any device, but it can also bloat the file size. Luckily, Aspose.Words for .NET offers a handy feature to embed only the necessary font subsets, keeping your PDFs lean and efficient. This tutorial will guide you through the process, step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- .NET Environment: Ensure you have a working .NET development environment.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along.

## Import Namespaces

To use Aspose.Words for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. Add these at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, we need to load the Word document that we want to convert to PDF. This is done using the `Document` class provided by Aspose.Words.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

This code snippet loads the document located at `dataDir`. Make sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your document.

## Step 2: Configure PDF Save Options

Next, we configure the `PdfSaveOptions` to ensure that only the necessary font subsets are embedded. By setting `EmbedFullFonts` to `false`, we tell Aspose.Words to embed only the glyphs used in the document.

```csharp
// The output PDF will contain subsets of the fonts in the document.
// Only the glyphs used in the document are included in the PDF fonts.
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions { EmbedFullFonts = false };
```

This small but crucial step helps reduce the PDF file size significantly.

## Step 3: Save the Document as PDF

Finally, we save the document as a PDF using the `Save` method, applying the configured `PdfSaveOptions`.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.EmbedSubsetFonts.pdf", saveOptions);
```

This code will generate a PDF file with the name `WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.EmbedSubsetFonts.pdf` in the specified directory, with only the necessary font subsets embedded.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these simple steps, you can efficiently reduce the size of your PDF files by embedding only the necessary font subsets using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only saves storage space but also ensures faster load times and better performance, especially for documents with extensive fonts.

## FAQ's

### Why should I embed only font subsets in a PDF?
Embedding only the necessary font subsets can significantly reduce the PDF file size without compromising on the document's appearance and readability.

### Can I revert to embedding full fonts if needed?
Yes, you can. Simply set the `EmbedFullFonts` property to `true` in the `PdfSaveOptions`.

### Does Aspose.Words for .NET support other PDF optimization features?
Absolutely! Aspose.Words for .NET offers a range of options for optimizing PDFs, including image compression and removing unused objects.

### What types of fonts can be subset embedded using Aspose.Words for .NET?
Aspose.Words for .NET supports subset embedding for all TrueType fonts used in the document.

### How can I verify which fonts are embedded in my PDF?
You can open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Reader and check the properties under the Fonts tab to see the embedded fonts.
