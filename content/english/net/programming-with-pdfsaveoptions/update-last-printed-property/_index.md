Let's break down the process into simple, manageable steps.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First things first, let's set up your project. Open Visual Studio, create a new Console App (.NET Framework or .NET Core), and name it something meaningful like "UpdateLastPrintedPropertyPDF".

string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 4: Configure PDF Save Options

We need to configure the PDF save options to update the last printed property. Create a new instance of `PdfSaveOptions` and set the `UpdateLastPrintedProperty` property to `true`.

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions { InterpolateImages = true };
```

## Step 5: Save the Document as PDF

Finally, save the document as a PDF with the updated property. Specify the output path and the save options.
