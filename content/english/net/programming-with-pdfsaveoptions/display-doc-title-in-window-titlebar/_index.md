## Introduction

Are you ready to make your PDFs look even more professional? One small but impactful change is displaying the document title in the window title bar. It’s like putting a name tag on your PDF, making it instantly recognizable. Today, we’ll dive into how to achieve this using Aspose.Words for .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll have a crystal-clear understanding of the process. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the steps, let's make sure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: We’ll be writing code in C#.

Ensure you've got these in place, and we’re good to go!

## Import Namespaces

First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This is crucial as it allows you to access the classes and methods required for our task.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load Your Document

The journey begins with loading your existing Word document. This document will be converted to a PDF with the title displayed in the window title bar.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

In this step, you specify the path to your document. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your document is stored.

## Step 2: Configure PDF Save Options

Next, we need to set the options for saving the document as a PDF. Here, we’ll specify that the document title should be displayed in the window title bar.

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions
{
    DisplayDocTitle = true
};
```

By setting `DisplayDocTitle` to `true`, we instruct Aspose.Words to use the document title in the PDF’s window title bar.

## Step 3: Save the Document as a PDF

Finally, we save the document as a PDF, applying the options we’ve configured.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.DisplayDocTitleInWindowTitlebar.pdf", saveOptions);
```

This line of code takes care of saving your document in PDF format with the title displayed in the title bar. Again, make sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory path.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! With just a few lines of code, you've successfully configured your PDF to display the document title in the window title bar using Aspose.Words for .NET. This small enhancement can make your PDFs look more polished and professional.
