## Introduction

When working with documents, especially for professional or academic purposes, organizing your content effectively is crucial. One way to enhance the usability of your PDF documents is by setting outline options. Outlines, or bookmarks, allow users to navigate through the document efficiently, just like chapters in a book. In this guide, we’ll dive into how you can set these options using Aspose.Words for .NET, ensuring your PDF files are well-organized and user-friendly.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, there are a few things you'll need to ensure you have:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed. If not, you can [download the latest version here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. A .NET Development Environment: You’ll need a working .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will help you follow along easily.
4. A Word Document: Have a Word document ready that you’ll convert into a PDF.

## Import Namespaces

First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This is where you'll include the Aspose.Words library to interact with your document. Here’s how to set it up:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Define the Document Path

To begin, you'll need to specify the path to your Word document. This is the file you want to convert to a PDF with outline options. 

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

In the code snippet above, replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your document directory. This tells the program where to find the Word document.

## Step 2: Configure PDF Save Options

Next, you need to configure the PDF save options. This includes setting how outlines should be handled in the PDF output. You’ll use the `PdfSaveOptions` class to do this.

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

Now, let's set the outline options. 

### Set Headings Outline Levels

The `HeadingsOutlineLevels` property defines how many levels of headings should be included in the PDF outline. For instance, if you set it to 3, it will include up to three levels of headings in the PDF outline.

```csharp
saveOptions.OutlineOptions.HeadingsOutlineLevels = 3;
```

### Set Expanded Outline Levels

The `ExpandedOutlineLevels` property controls how many levels of the outline should be expanded by default when the PDF is opened. Setting this to 1 will expand the top-level headings, giving a clear view of the main sections.

```csharp
saveOptions.OutlineOptions.ExpandedOutlineLevels = 1;
```

## Step 3: Save the Document as PDF

With the options configured, you’re ready to save the document as a PDF. Use the `Save` method of the `Document` class and pass in the file path and save options.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.SetOutlineOptions.pdf", saveOptions);
```

This line of code saves your Word document as a PDF, applying the outline options you configured. 

## Conclusion

Setting outline options in a PDF document can greatly enhance its navigability, making it easier for users to find and access the sections they need. With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can easily configure these settings to fit your needs, ensuring that your PDF documents are as user-friendly as possible.

### Can I set different heading levels for different sections in my document?

No, the outline settings apply globally across the entire document. However, you can structure your document with appropriate heading levels to achieve a similar effect.

### How can I preview the changes before saving the PDF?

You can use PDF viewers that support outline navigation to check how the outline appears. Some applications provide a preview feature for this.

### Is it possible to remove the outline after saving the PDF?

Yes, you can remove outlines using PDF editing software, but this isn’t directly achievable with Aspose.Words once the PDF is created.

### What other PDF save options can I configure with Aspose.Words?

Aspose.Words provides various options such as setting the PDF compliance level, embedding fonts, and adjusting image quality.
