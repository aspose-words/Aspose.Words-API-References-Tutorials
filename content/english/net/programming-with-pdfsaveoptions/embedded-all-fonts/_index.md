## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces. This step is crucial as it sets up the environment for using Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Now, let's break down the process into easy-to-follow steps. Each step will guide you through a specific part of embedding fonts in your PDF document using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Before diving into the code, you need to set up your document directory. This is where your sample Word document (`Rendering.docx`) and the output PDF will reside.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your document directory. This is where all the magic will happen!

## Step 2: Load Your Word Document

Next, you'll load your Word document into the Aspose.Words `Document` object. This is the document you'll be working with.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

In this line, we create a new `Document` object and load the `Rendering.docx` file from our document directory.

## Step 3: Configure PDF Save Options

Now, it's time to configure the PDF save options. Specifically, we'll set the `EmbedFullFonts` property to `true` to ensure all fonts used in the document are embedded in the PDF.

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions { EmbedFullFonts = true };
```

This line creates a new `PdfSaveOptions` object and sets the `EmbedFullFonts` property to `true`. This ensures that the generated PDF will include all the fonts used in the document.

## Step 4: Save the Document as PDF

Finally, you'll save the Word document as a PDF with the specified save options. This step converts the document and embeds the fonts.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.EmbeddedFontsInPdf.pdf", saveOptions);
```

In this line, we save the document as a PDF in the document directory, embedding all the fonts used in the Word document.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully embedded fonts in a PDF document using Aspose.Words for .NET. With this knowledge, you can ensure that your PDFs retain their intended appearance, no matter where they're viewed. Isn't that cool? Now, go ahead and give it a try with your own documents.
