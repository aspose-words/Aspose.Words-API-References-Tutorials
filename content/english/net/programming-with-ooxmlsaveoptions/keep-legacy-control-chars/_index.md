## Import Namespaces

Before writing your code, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Add the following lines to the top of your C# file:

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

First, you'll need to set up your project in Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE).

Next, you'll load the Word document that contains the legacy control characters.

1. Specify the document path: Set the path to your document directory.
   
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
   ```

2. Load the document: Use the `Document` class to load your document.

   ```csharp
   Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Legacy control character.doc");
   ```

## Step 3: Configure Save Options

Now, let's configure the save options to keep the legacy control characters intact.

1. Create Save Options: Initialize an instance of `OoxmlSaveOptions` and set the `KeepLegacyControlChars` property to `true`.

   ```csharp
   OoxmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new OoxmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.FlatOpc)
   {
       KeepLegacyControlChars = true
   };
   ```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, save the document with the configured save options.

1. Save the document: Use the `Save` method of the `Document` class to save the document with the specified save options.

   ```csharp
   doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithOoxmlSaveOptions.KeepLegacyControlChars.docx", saveOptions);
   ```
