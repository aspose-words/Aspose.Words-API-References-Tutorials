## Introduction

Ever wondered how to keep track of the last saved time property in your Word documents programmatically? If you’re dealing with multiple documents and need to maintain their metadata, updating the last saved time property can be quite handy. Today, I’m going to walk you through this process using Aspose.Words for .NET. So, buckle up and let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the step-by-step guide, there are a few things you'll need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed. If you haven't, you can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: A development environment like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics of C# programming will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

To begin with, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This will allow you to access the classes and methods required for manipulating Word documents.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

Now, let’s break down the process into simple steps. Each step will guide you through the process of updating the last saved time property in your Word document.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First, you need to specify the path to your document directory. This is where your existing document is stored and where the updated document will be saved.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your directory.

## Step 2: Load Your Word Document

Next, load the Word document you want to update. You can do this by creating an instance of the `Document` class and passing the path of your document.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

Ensure that the document named `Document.docx` is present in the specified directory.

## Step 3: Configure Save Options

Now, create an instance of the `OoxmlSaveOptions` class. This class allows you to specify options for saving your document in the Office Open XML (OOXML) format. Here, you’ll set the `UpdateLastSavedTimeProperty` to `true`.

```csharp
OoxmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new OoxmlSaveOptions
{
    UpdateLastSavedTimeProperty = true
};
```

This tells Aspose.Words to update the last saved time property of the document.

## Step 4: Save the Updated Document

Finally, save the document using the `Save` method of the `Document` class, passing in the path where you want to save the updated document and the save options.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithOoxmlSaveOptions.UpdateLastSavedTimeProperty.docx", saveOptions);
```

This will save the document with the updated last saved time property.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you can easily update the last saved time property of your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. This is especially useful for maintaining accurate metadata in your documents, which can be crucial for document management systems and various other applications.
