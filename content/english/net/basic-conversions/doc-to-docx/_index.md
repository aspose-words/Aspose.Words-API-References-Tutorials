## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to convert DOC files to DOCX format using Aspose.Words for .NET. Aspose.Words is a powerful document processing library that allows developers to manipulate and convert Word documents programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following set up:
- Visual Studio installed on your system.

- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```

This namespace provides access to the Aspose.Words API, enabling you to work with Word documents in your application.

## Step 1: Load the DOC File

Start by loading the DOC file you want to convert:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Load the DOC file using Aspose.Words
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.doc");
```

## Step 2: Save as DOCX

Next, save the loaded document as DOCX format:
```csharp
// Save the document as DOCX
doc.Save(dataDir + "ConvertedDocument.docx", SaveFormat.Docx);
```

## Step 3: Run the Code

Compile and run your application to execute the conversion process. Ensure that the input file "Document.doc" exists in the specified directory.

## Step 4: Verify the Output

Check the output directory for the converted DOCX file named "ConvertedDocument.docx". You have successfully converted a DOC file to DOCX using Aspose.Words for .NET!
