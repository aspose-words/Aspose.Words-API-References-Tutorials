## Introduction
Are you looking to convert DOCX files to RTF using Aspose.Words for .NET? You've come to the right place! This tutorial will guide you through the process step-by-step, ensuring you understand every detail.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. A valid Aspose license: You can purchase a full license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or get a temporary one [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.

## Import Namespaces

To begin with, we need to import the necessary namespaces. These will allow us to work with Aspose.Words and handle file operations.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

First, you need to set up your development environment. Create a new project in your IDE and install Aspose.Words for .NET.

1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project.
2. Install Aspose.Words for .NET: You can install it via NuGet Package Manager by searching for "Aspose.Words".

```sh
Install-Package Aspose.Words
```

## Step 2: Initialize the Document Directory

Next, we need to specify the directory where your DOCX file is located. This will be used to read the DOCX file and save the converted RTF file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Load the DOCX Document

Now, let's load the DOCX document. We use a `Stream` to open the document in read-only mode.

```csharp
using (Stream stream = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "Document.docx"))
{
    Document doc = new Document(stream);
    // The stream will be closed automatically when the using block is exited.
}
```

## Step 4: Convert DOCX to RTF

After loading the document, it's time to convert it to RTF format. We save the document to a `MemoryStream`.

```csharp
MemoryStream dstStream = new MemoryStream();
doc.Save(dstStream, SaveFormat.Rtf);
```

## Step 5: Save the RTF Document

Finally, we need to save the converted RTF document to the specified directory. Make sure to rewind the stream position back to zero before saving.

```csharp
dstStream.Position = 0;
File.WriteAllBytes(dataDir + "BaseConversions.DocxToRtf.rtf", dstStream.ToArray());
```
