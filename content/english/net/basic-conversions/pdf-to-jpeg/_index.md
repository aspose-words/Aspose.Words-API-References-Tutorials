2. .NET Framework: Make sure you have the .NET environment set up on your machine.
3. Visual Studio: Any version will do, as long as you’re comfortable navigating through it.
4. A PDF file: Have your PDF file ready to be converted. For this tutorial, we’ll use a file named `Pdf Document.pdf`.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces. This step ensures that our code can access all the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Before diving into the code, you need to set up your project. Here’s how:

1. Open Visual Studio: Start by launching Visual Studio and creating a new C# project.
2. Install Aspose.Words: Use NuGet Package Manager to install Aspose.Words for .NET. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).

3. Create a Directory: Set up a directory to store your PDF and the resulting JPEG files.

## Step 2: Load Your PDF Document

Now that our project is ready, let's load the PDF document. This is where Aspose.Words shines!

1. Define Your Directory Path: Set the path to your documents directory. This is where your PDF file is stored.

    ```csharp
    string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
    ```

2. Load the PDF: Use the `Document` class from Aspose.Words to load your PDF.

    ```csharp
    Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Pdf Document.pdf");
    ```

## Step 3: Convert PDF to JPEG

With our PDF loaded, it’s time to perform the conversion. This step is surprisingly straightforward.

1. Save as JPEG: Utilize the `Save` method to convert the PDF into a JPEG image.

    ```csharp
    doc.Save(dataDir + "BaseConversions.PdfToJpeg.jpeg");
    ```
