## Introduction

In today's digital age, converting documents from one format to another and sending them via email is a common task. This article will walk you through the process of converting a DOCX file to MHTML format and then sending it as an email using Aspose.Words for .NET. We'll break down each step in a detailed, easy-to-follow guide, ensuring you understand the process from start to finish. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Words for .NET library from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Aspose.Email for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Email for .NET library from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.
4. SMTP Server: You need access to an SMTP server to send emails.

## Import Namespaces

To use Aspose.Words and Aspose.Email in your project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Add the following using directives at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Smtp;
```

Let's break down the process into multiple steps to ensure you understand each part clearly.

## Step 1: Load the DOCX Document

First, you need to load the DOCX document you want to convert. Use the `Document` class from Aspose.Words to load your DOCX file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Save the Document as MHTML

Next, save the loaded document as an MHTML file. This is done using the `Save` method of the `Document` class.

```csharp
Stream stream = new MemoryStream();
doc.Save(stream, SaveFormat.Mhtml);

// Rewind the stream to the beginning so Aspose.Email can read it.
stream.Position = 0;
```

## Step 3: Create an Email Message

Now, create an email message from the MHTML stream using Aspose.Email. You'll use the `MailMessage` class for this purpose.

```csharp
// Create an Aspose.Email MIME email message from the stream.
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load(stream, new MhtmlLoadOptions());
message.From = "your_from@email.com";
message.To = "your_to@email.com";
message.Subject = "Aspose.Words + Aspose.Email MHTML Test Message";
```

## Step 4: Send the Email

Finally, send the email using an SMTP client. Configure the SMTP client with your SMTP server details and use the `Send` method to send the message.

```csharp
// Send the message using Aspose.Email.
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient();
client.Host = "your_smtp.com";
client.Send(message);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully converted a DOCX document to MHTML and sent it via email using Aspose.Words for .NET. This process involves loading the document, converting it to MHTML, creating an email message, and sending it using an SMTP client. With these steps, you can easily automate the conversion and emailing of documents in your applications.
