## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your Word document manipulations using Aspose.Words for .NET? Well, you're in the right place! In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of inserting an advance field into a Word document without using the DocumentBuilder class. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to achieve this using Aspose.Words for .NET. So, let's dive in and make your document processing even more powerful and versatile!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Visual Studio: Any recent version will do.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: This tutorial assumes you have a fundamental understanding of C# programming.
- Aspose.Words License: Obtain a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) if you don't have one.

## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported into your project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fields;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First things first, let's set up our Visual Studio project.

### Create a New Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Select Create a new project.
3. Choose Console App (.NET Core) and click Next.
4. Name your project and click Create.

### Install Aspose.Words for .NET

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.Words and install the latest version.

## Step 2: Initialize Document and Paragraph

Now that our project is set up, we need to initialize a new document and a paragraph where we will insert the advance field.

### Initialize Document

1. In your `Program.cs` file, start by creating a new document:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
```

This sets up a new, empty document.

### Add a Paragraph

2. Get the first paragraph in the document:

```csharp
Paragraph para = (Paragraph)doc.GetChild(NodeType.Paragraph, 0, true);
```

This ensures we have a paragraph to work with.

## Step 3: Insert the Advance Field

Now, let's insert the advance field into our paragraph.

### Create the Field

1. Append the advance field to the paragraph:

```csharp
FieldAdvance field = (FieldAdvance)para.AppendField(FieldType.FieldAdvance, false);
```

This creates a new advance field in our paragraph.

### Set Field Properties

2. Configure the field properties to specify offsets and positions:

```csharp
field.DownOffset = "10";
field.LeftOffset = "10";
field.RightOffset = "-3.3";
field.UpOffset = "0";
field.HorizontalPosition = "100";
field.VerticalPosition = "100";
```

These settings adjust the position of the text relative to its normal position.

## Step 4: Update and Save the Document

With the field inserted and configured, it's time to update and save the document.

### Update the Field

1. Ensure the field is updated to reflect our changes:

```csharp
field.Update();
```

This makes sure all field properties are applied correctly.

### Save the Document

2. Save your document to the specified directory:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "InsertionFieldAdvanceWithoutDocumentBuilder.docx");
```

This saves the document with the advance field included.
