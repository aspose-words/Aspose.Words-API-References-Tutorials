## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, managing and manipulating documents is a crucial task, often requiring efficient handling of hyperlinks within documents. Aspose.Words for .NET provides powerful capabilities to seamlessly replace hyperlinks, ensuring your documents are dynamically linked to the right resources. This tutorial dives deep into how you can achieve this using Aspose.Words for .NET, guiding you step-by-step through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into replacing hyperlinks with Aspose.Words for .NET, ensure you have the following:

- Visual Studio: Installed and set up for .NET development.
- Aspose.Words for .NET: Downloaded and referenced in your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Familiarity with C#: Basic understanding to write and compile code.

## Import Namespaces

First, make sure to include the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fields;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

Begin by loading the document where you want to replace hyperlinks:

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Hyperlinks.docx");
```

Replace `"Hyperlinks.docx"` with the path to your actual document.

## Step 2: Iterate Through Fields

Iterate through each field in the document to find and replace hyperlinks:

```csharp
foreach (Field field in doc.Range.Fields)
{
    if (field.Type == FieldType.FieldHyperlink)
    {
        FieldHyperlink hyperlink = (FieldHyperlink)field;
        
        // Check if the hyperlink is not a local link (ignore bookmarks).
        if (hyperlink.SubAddress != null)
            continue;
        
        // Replace the hyperlink address and result.
        hyperlink.Address = "http://www.aspose.com";
        hyperlink.Result = "Aspose - The .NET & Java Component Publisher";
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Save the Document

Finally, save the modified document with replaced hyperlinks:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFields.ReplaceHyperlinks.docx");
```

Replace `"WorkingWithFields.ReplaceHyperlinks.docx"` with your desired output file path.
