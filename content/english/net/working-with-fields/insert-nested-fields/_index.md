## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself needing to insert nested fields in your Word documents programmatically? Maybe you want to conditionally display different texts based on the page number? Well, you’re in luck! This tutorial will guide you through the process of inserting nested fields using Aspose.Words for .NET. Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few things you’ll need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding of C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces

First, make sure to import the necessary namespaces in your project. These namespaces contain classes that you’ll need to interact with Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fields;
using Aspose.Words.HeaderFooter;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Document

The first step is to create a new document and a DocumentBuilder object. The DocumentBuilder class helps in building and modifying Word documents.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Create the document and the DocumentBuilder.
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Insert Page Breaks

Next, we’ll insert a few page breaks into the document. This will allow us to demonstrate the nested fields effectively.

```csharp
// Insert page breaks.
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    builder.InsertBreak(BreakType.PageBreak);
}
```

## Step 3: Move to Footer

After inserting page breaks, we need to move to the footer of the document. This is where we’ll insert our nested field.

```csharp
// Move to footer.
builder.MoveToHeaderFooter(HeaderFooterType.FooterPrimary);
```

## Step 4: Insert Nested Field

Now, let’s insert the nested field. We’ll use the IF field to conditionally display text based on the current page number.

```csharp
// Insert nested field.
Field field = builder.InsertField(@"IF ");
builder.MoveTo(field.Separator);
builder.InsertField("PAGE");
builder.Write(" <> ");
builder.InsertField("NUMPAGES");
builder.Write(" \"See next page\" \"Last page\" ");
```

In this step, we first insert the IF field, move to its separator, and then insert the PAGE and NUMPAGES fields. The IF field checks if the current page number (PAGE) is not equal to the total number of pages (NUMPAGES). If true, it displays “See next page”, otherwise, it displays “Last page”.

## Step 5: Update the Field

Finally, we update the field to ensure it displays the correct text.

```csharp
// Update the field.
field.Update();
```

## Step 6: Save the Document

The last step is to save the document to your specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "InsertNestedFields.docx");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully inserted nested fields into a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This powerful library makes it incredibly easy to manipulate Word documents programmatically. Whether you’re generating reports, creating templates, or automating document workflows, Aspose.Words has got you covered.
