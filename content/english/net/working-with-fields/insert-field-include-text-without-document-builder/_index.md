## Introduction

In the world of document automation and manipulation, Aspose.Words for .NET stands as a powerful tool. Today, we're diving into a detailed guide on how to insert a FieldIncludeText without using DocumentBuilder. This tutorial will walk you through the process step-by-step, ensuring you understand each part of the code and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the latest version installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Any .NET-compatible IDE like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, we need to import the necessary namespaces. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods required for manipulating Word documents.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fields;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps. Each step will be explained in detail to ensure clarity.

## Step 1: Set the Directory Path

The first step is to define the path to your documents directory. This is where your Word documents will be stored and accessed.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Create the Document and Paragraph

Next, we create a new document and a paragraph within that document. This paragraph will hold the FieldIncludeText field.

```csharp
// Create the document and the paragraph.
Document doc = new Document();
Paragraph para = new Paragraph(doc);
```

## Step 3: Insert FieldIncludeText Field

Now, we insert the FieldIncludeText field into the paragraph. This field allows you to include the text from another document.

```csharp
// Insert FieldIncludeText field.
FieldIncludeText fieldIncludeText = (FieldIncludeText)para.AppendField(FieldType.FieldIncludeText, false);
```

## Step 4: Set Field Properties

We need to specify the properties for the FieldIncludeText field. This includes setting the bookmark name and the source document's full path.

```csharp
fieldIncludeText.BookmarkName = "bookmark";
fieldIncludeText.SourceFullName = dataDir + "IncludeText.docx";
```

## Step 5: Append Paragraph to Document

With the field set up, we append the paragraph to the document's first section body.

```csharp
doc.FirstSection.Body.AppendChild(para);
```

## Step 6: Update Field

Before saving the document, we need to update the FieldIncludeText to ensure it pulls in the correct content from the source document.

```csharp
fieldIncludeText.Update();
```

## Step 7: Save the Document

Finally, we save the document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "InsertionFieldFieldIncludeTextWithoutDocumentBuilder.docx");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you can easily insert a FieldIncludeText without using DocumentBuilder in Aspose.Words for .NET. This approach provides a streamlined way to include content from one document into another, making your document automation tasks much simpler.
