## Introduction

In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into using Aspose.Words for .NET to manage document revisions effectively. Whether you're a developer or a tech enthusiast, understanding how to ignore text inside insert revisions can streamline your document processing workflows. This tutorial will equip you with the necessary skills to leverage Aspose.Words' powerful features for managing document revisions seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Words for .NET library integrated into your project.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces

To begin, include the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Replacing;
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Document and Start Tracking Revisions

First, initialize a new document and start tracking revisions:
```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Start tracking revisions
doc.StartTrackRevisions("author", DateTime.Now);
builder.Writeln("Inserted"); // Insert text with tracking revisions
doc.StopTrackRevisions();
```

## Step 2: Insert Non-Revised Text

Next, insert text into the document without tracking revisions:
```csharp
builder.Write("Text");
```

## Step 3: Ignore Inserted Text Using FindReplaceOptions

Now, configure FindReplaceOptions to ignore inserted revisions:
```csharp
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions { IgnoreInserted = true };

Regex regex = new Regex("e");
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
```

## Step 4: Output Document Text

Display the document text after ignoring inserted revisions:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
```

## Step 5: Revert Ignore Inserted Text Option

To revert ignoring inserted text, modify the FindReplaceOptions:
```csharp
options.IgnoreInserted = false;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
```
