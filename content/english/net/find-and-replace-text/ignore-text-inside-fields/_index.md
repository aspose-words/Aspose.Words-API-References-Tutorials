## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into manipulating text inside fields within Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. Aspose.Words provides robust features for document processing, allowing developers to automate tasks efficiently. Here, we'll focus on ignoring text inside fields, a common requirement in document automation scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Words for .NET library integrated into your project.
- Basic familiarity with C# programming and .NET environment.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, include the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Builder;
using Aspose.Words.FindReplace;
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Document and Builder

First, initialize a new Word document and a `DocumentBuilder` object to facilitate document construction:
```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Insert a Field with Text

Use the `InsertField` method of `DocumentBuilder` to add a field containing text:
```csharp
builder.InsertField("INCLUDETEXT", "Text in field");
```

## Step 3: Ignore Text Inside Fields

To manipulate text while ignoring content within fields, employ `FindReplaceOptions` with the `IgnoreFields` property set to `true`:
```csharp
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions { IgnoreFields = true };
```

## Step 4: Perform Text Replacement

Utilize regular expressions for text replacement. Here, we replace occurrences of the letter 'e' with an asterisk '*' throughout the document's range:
```csharp
Regex regex = new Regex("e");
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
```

## Step 5: Output Modified Document Text

Retrieve and print the modified text to verify the replacements made:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
```

## Step 6: Include Text Inside Fields

To process text inside fields, reset the `IgnoreFields` property to `false` and perform the replacement operation again:
```csharp
options.IgnoreFields = false;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to manipulate text inside fields in Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. This capability is essential for scenarios where field content needs special handling while processing documents programmatically.
