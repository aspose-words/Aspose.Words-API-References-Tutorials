## Introduction

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of text manipulation using Aspose.Words for .NET! Today, we'll explore how to recognize and substitute text within replacement patterns, a crucial skill for automating and enhancing your document processing tasks. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get our hands dirty with code, let’s ensure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Any IDE like Visual Studio will do.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: If you’re familiar with C#, you’re good to go!

## Import Namespaces

To start, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Here’s how you can do that:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Replacing;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
```

Now, let's break down the example into manageable steps. Each step will guide you through the process of recognizing and substituting text within replacement patterns using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Initialize the Document

First things first, you need to create a new document. This document will serve as your canvas for the text replacement.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

The `Document` object is the core of Aspose.Words. It represents the entire Word document.

## Step 2: Add Text to the Document

Next, let's add some text to the document. This text will be the target of our replacement operations.

```csharp
builder.Write("Jason give money to Paul.");
```

The `DocumentBuilder` class is a powerful tool for adding text and other elements to your document.

## Step 3: Define the Regex Pattern

To recognize the text you want to replace, you need to define a regex pattern. This pattern will match the specific text in your document.

```csharp
Regex regex = new Regex(@"([A-z]+) give money to ([A-z]+)");
```

In this regex, `([A-z]+)` matches any word consisting of letters, making it flexible for various names.

## Step 4: Set Replacement Options

Aspose.Words allows you to use substitutions in your replacements. You need to set these options before performing the replacement.

```csharp
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions { UseSubstitutions = true };
```

The `FindReplaceOptions` class provides various options for customizing your find and replace operations.

## Step 5: Perform the Replacement

Now, let's perform the replacement operation. This is where the magic happens!

```csharp
doc.Range.Replace(regex, @"$2 take money from $1", options);
```

Here, `$2` and `$1` are substitution patterns. `$2` refers to the second captured group (Paul), and `$1` refers to the first captured group (Jason). The result will be "Paul take money from Jason."

## Step 6: Save the Document

Finally, don’t forget to save your document to see the changes.

```csharp
doc.Save("Output.docx");
```

You can save the document in various formats like DOCX, PDF, HTML, etc. Aspose.Words provides robust support for multiple formats.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully learned how to recognize and substitute text within replacement patterns using Aspose.Words for .NET. This powerful feature can save you a lot of time and effort in document processing tasks. Whether you’re automating reports, generating documents, or simply managing text, Aspose.Words has got you covered.
