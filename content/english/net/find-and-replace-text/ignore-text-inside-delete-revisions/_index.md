## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.Words stands out as a robust library for working with Microsoft Word documents programmatically. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, mastering the capabilities of Aspose.Words can significantly enhance your ability to manipulate, create, and manage Word documents efficiently. This tutorial dives into one of its powerful features: handling tracked revisions within documents using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Aspose.Words for .NET library integrated into your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Replacing;
```
## Step 1: Create a New Document and Insert Text

First, initialize a new instance of `Document` and a `DocumentBuilder` to start building your document:
```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Insert Text and Track Revisions

You can insert text into the document and track revisions by starting and stopping revision tracking:
```csharp
builder.Writeln("Deleted");
builder.Write("Text");

doc.StartTrackRevisions("author", DateTime.Now);
doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.Remove();
doc.StopTrackRevisions();
```

## Step 3: Replace Text Using Regular Expressions

To manipulate text, you can use regular expressions to find and replace specific patterns:
```csharp
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions { IgnoreDeleted = true };

Regex regex = new Regex("e");
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);

Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());

options.IgnoreDeleted = false;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);

Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
```
