## Introduction

Have you ever needed to embed an OLE object, like a PowerPoint presentation or an Excel spreadsheet, into a Word document, but wanted it to appear as a neat little icon rather than a full object? Well, you’re in the right place! In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through how to insert an OLE object as an icon in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to seamlessly integrate OLE objects into your documents, making them more interactive and visually appealing.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details, let's cover what you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can download it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: You need an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A basic understanding of C# programming will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This is essential for accessing the Aspose.Words library functions.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Document

To start with, you need to create a new Word document instance.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

This code snippet initializes a new Word document and a DocumentBuilder object which is used to build the document content.

## Step 2: Insert OLE Object as Icon

Now, let’s insert the OLE object as an icon. The `InsertOleObjectAsIcon` method of the DocumentBuilder class is used for this purpose.

```csharp
builder.InsertOleObjectAsIcon("path_to_your_presentation.pptx", false, "path_to_your_icon.ico", "My embedded file");
```

Let's break down this method:
- `"path_to_your_presentation.pptx"`: This is the path to the OLE object you want to embed.
- `false`: This boolean parameter specifies whether to display the OLE object as an icon. Since we want an icon, we set it to `false`.
- `"path_to_your_icon.ico"`: This is the path to the icon file you want to use for the OLE object.
- `"My embedded file"`: This is the label that will appear below the icon.

## Step 3: Save the Document

Finally, you need to save the document. Choose the directory where you want to save your file.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithOleObjectsAndActiveX.InsertOleObjectAsIcon.docx");
```

This line of code saves the document to the specified path.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully learned how to insert an OLE object as an icon in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This technique not only helps in embedding complex objects but also keeps your document tidy and professional.
