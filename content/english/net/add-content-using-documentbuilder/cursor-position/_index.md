```

## Step 2: Access the Current Node and Paragraph
Next, retrieve the current node and paragraph where the cursor is positioned. This can be achieved using the CurrentNode and CurrentParagraph properties of the DocumentBuilder class:

```csharp
Node curNode = builder.CurrentNode;
Paragraph curParagraph = builder.CurrentParagraph;
```

## Step 3: Retrieve Cursor Position Information
Now, you can retrieve information about the cursor position. In the following code snippet, we print the text of the current paragraph:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nCursor move to paragraph: " + curParagraph.GetText());
```
