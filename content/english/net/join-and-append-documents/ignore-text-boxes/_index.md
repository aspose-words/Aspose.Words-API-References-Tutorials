## Introduction

Welcome to this detailed tutorial on using Aspose.Words for .NET to merge Word documents while ignoring text boxes. If you're looking to streamline your document processing and ensure that the formatting of text boxes is maintained, you're in the right place. Let's dive into this step-by-step guide.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, let's ensure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding of basic programming concepts in C#.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Importing;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First, ensure your project is set up correctly. Open your IDE, create a new project, and install the Aspose.Words for .NET library via NuGet Package Manager.

### How to Install Aspose.Words

1. Open NuGet Package Manager in your IDE.
2. Search for "Aspose.Words".
3. Click on "Install".

## Step 2: Define Document Directory

Next, specify the directory where your source and destination documents are located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 3: Load the Documents

Now, load both the source and destination documents into your project.

```csharp
Document srcDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Document source.docx");
Document dstDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Northwind traders.docx");
```

## Step 4: Configure Import Options

To ensure the text boxes formatting is maintained, set the `IgnoreTextBoxes` option to `false`.

```csharp
ImportFormatOptions importFormatOptions = new ImportFormatOptions { IgnoreTextBoxes = false };
```

## Step 5: Initialize Node Importer

Initialize the `NodeImporter` to import nodes from the source document to the destination document.

```csharp
NodeImporter importer = new NodeImporter(srcDoc, dstDoc, ImportFormatMode.KeepSourceFormatting, importFormatOptions);
```

## Step 6: Import Paragraphs from Source Document

Fetch all paragraphs from the source document's first section.

```csharp
ParagraphCollection srcParas = srcDoc.FirstSection.Body.Paragraphs;
```

## Step 7: Append Imported Paragraphs to Destination Document

Loop through each paragraph and append it to the destination document.

```csharp
foreach (Paragraph srcPara in srcParas)
{
    Node importedNode = importer.ImportNode(srcPara, true);
    dstDoc.FirstSection.Body.AppendChild(importedNode);
}
```

## Step 8: Save the Merged Document

Finally, save the merged document with a new name to avoid overwriting the original files.

```csharp
dstDoc.Save(dataDir + "JoinAndAppendDocuments.IgnoreTextBoxes.docx");
```

## Conclusion

You've successfully merged two Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET while ensuring that text boxes are not ignored during the import. This process is invaluable for maintaining the formatting integrity of your documents. Whether you're dealing with reports, contracts, or any other type of document, Aspose.Words for .NET makes the process seamless.
