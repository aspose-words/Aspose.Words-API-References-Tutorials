## Introduction

Aspose.Words for .NET is a powerful library for manipulating Word documents programmatically. Whether you're merging documents or managing complex formatting, Aspose.Words offers a robust set of features to make your tasks easier. Today, we’ll dive into how to use destination styles when appending documents. This guide will walk you through everything from prerequisites to step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, let's ensure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: If you don't have it yet, download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other C# development environment.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics of C# programming will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the code, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This is crucial for accessing the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

Let's break down the process of using destination styles when appending documents into clear, manageable steps.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First, define the path to your document directory. This is where your source and destination documents are located. You’ll need to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your documents.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the Source Document

Next, load the source document that you want to append to the destination document. Aspose.Words provides a straightforward way to do this using the `Document` class.

```csharp
Document srcDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Document source.docx");
```

## Step 3: Load the Destination Document

Similarly, load the destination document where you want to append the source document. This will be the document whose styles you want to use.

```csharp
Document dstDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Northwind traders.docx");
```

## Step 4: Append the Source Document Using Destination Styles

Now comes the key part: appending the source document to the destination document while using the destination document's styles. The `AppendDocument` method of the `Document` class allows you to do this. The `ImportFormatMode.UseDestinationStyles` parameter ensures that the styles of the destination document are used.

```csharp
dstDoc.AppendDocument(srcDoc, ImportFormatMode.UseDestinationStyles);
```

## Step 5: Save the Resulting Document

Finally, save the resulting document. This new document will contain the content of the source document appended to the destination document, with the destination styles applied.

```csharp
dstDoc.Save(dataDir + "JoinAndAppendDocuments.UseDestinationStyles.docx");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you can seamlessly append one document to another while using the styles of the destination document. This technique is particularly useful when you need to maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple documents.
