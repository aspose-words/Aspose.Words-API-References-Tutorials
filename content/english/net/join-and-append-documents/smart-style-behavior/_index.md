## Introduction

Hey there, Word wizards! Ever found yourself tangled up in the hassle of combining documents while keeping the style intact? Imagine you’ve got two Word documents, each with its own flair, and you need to merge them without losing that unique touch. Sounds tricky, right? Well, today, we’re diving into the magical world of Aspose.Words for .NET to show you how to achieve this effortlessly using Smart Style Behavior. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be a pro at merging documents like a style-savvy sorcerer!

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this document-merging adventure, let’s make sure we’ve got everything we need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you’ve got the latest version. If not, grab it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: Any .NET compatible environment will do, like Visual Studio.
- Two Word Documents: For this tutorial, we’ll use “Document source.docx” and “Northwind traders.docx”.
- Aspose License: To avoid any limitations, get your [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) if you haven’t purchased one yet.

### Import Namespaces

First things first, let’s get our namespaces in order. These are essential to access the features we need from Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load Your Documents

To start, we need to load our source and destination documents into our application.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Load the source document
Document srcDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Document source.docx");

// Load the destination document
Document dstDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Northwind traders.docx");
```

Explanation:
Here, we’re loading “Document source.docx” and “Northwind traders.docx” from the specified directory. Make sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your documents are stored.

## Step 2: Initialize DocumentBuilder

Next, we need to create a `DocumentBuilder` object for the destination document. This will allow us to manipulate the content of the document.

```csharp
// Initialize DocumentBuilder for the destination document
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(dstDoc);
```

Explanation:
The `DocumentBuilder` is a handy tool that provides methods to navigate and modify the document. Here, we’re tying it to our destination document.

## Step 3: Move to Document End and Insert a Page Break

Now, let’s navigate to the end of the destination document and insert a page break. This ensures the content from the source document starts on a new page.

```csharp
// Move to the end of the document
builder.MoveToDocumentEnd();

// Insert a page break
builder.InsertBreak(BreakType.PageBreak);
```

Explanation:
By moving to the end of the document and inserting a page break, we ensure that the new content starts on a fresh page, maintaining a clean and organized structure.

## Step 4: Set Smart Style Behavior

Before we merge the documents, we need to set the `SmartStyleBehavior` to `true`. This option helps in maintaining the styles from the source document intelligently.

```csharp
// Set smart style behavior
ImportFormatOptions options = new ImportFormatOptions { SmartStyleBehavior = true };
```

Explanation:
`SmartStyleBehavior` ensures that the styles from the source document are integrated smoothly into the destination document, avoiding any style conflicts.

## Step 5: Insert Source Document into Destination Document

Finally, let’s insert the source document into the destination document using the specified format options.

```csharp
// Insert the source document at the current position of the destination document
builder.InsertDocument(srcDoc, ImportFormatMode.UseDestinationStyles, options);
```

Explanation:
This command merges the source document into the destination document at the current position (which is the end, after the page break), and it uses the destination document’s styles while intelligently applying the source styles where needed.

## Step 6: Save the Combined Document

Last but not least, we save our combined document.

```csharp
// Save the combined document
builder.Document.Save(dataDir + "JoinAndAppendDocuments.SmartStyleBehavior.docx");
```

Explanation:
We’re saving the final product as “JoinAndAppendDocuments.SmartStyleBehavior.docx” in the specified directory. Now you’ve got a perfectly merged document with preserved styles!

## Conclusion

No more style mishaps or formatting headaches—just smooth, stylish documents every time. Whether you’re combining reports, proposals, or any other documents, this method ensures everything looks just right.
