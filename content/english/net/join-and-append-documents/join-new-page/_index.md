## Introduction

When working with large documents or merging multiple documents into one, maintaining formatting and ensuring clarity is crucial. Aspose.Words for .NET provides powerful tools to manipulate Word documents programmatically, allowing developers to perform complex tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Words for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and .NET environment.

## Import Namespaces

First, import the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using System;
```

Follow these steps to join and append documents while ensuring the appended content starts on a new page:

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Start by creating a new C# console application in Visual Studio. Install the Aspose.Words NuGet package to your project.

## Step 2: Load Source and Destination Documents

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Load source and destination documents
Document srcDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Document source.docx");
Document dstDoc = new Document(dataDir + "Northwind traders.docx");
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your document files.

## Step 3: Set Section Start to New Page

Set the section start of the first section in the source document to start on a new page:

```csharp
srcDoc.FirstSection.PageSetup.SectionStart = SectionStart.NewPage;
```

This ensures that the appended content begins on a new page in the destination document.

## Step 4: Append Source Document to Destination Document

Append the source document to the destination document while preserving the original formatting:

```csharp
// Append the source document using the original styles found in the source document.
dstDoc.AppendDocument(srcDoc, ImportFormatMode.KeepSourceFormatting);
```

## Step 5: Save the Modified Document

Save the modified destination document to a new file:

```csharp
dstDoc.Save(dataDir + "JoinAndAppendDocuments.JoinNewPage.docx");
```

This saves the combined document with the appended content starting on a new page.

In this tutorial, we have learned how to join and append documents in a Word file using Aspose.Words for .NET. By following these steps, you can efficiently merge multiple documents while ensuring the appended content begins on a new page, preserving the original formatting.
