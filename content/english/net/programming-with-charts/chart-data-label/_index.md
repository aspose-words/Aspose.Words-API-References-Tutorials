## Introduction

Are you looking to spruce up your .NET applications with dynamic and customized document processing capabilities? Aspose.Words for .NET might just be your answer! In this guide, we'll dive deep into customizing chart data labels using Aspose.Words for .NET, a powerful library for creating, modifying, and converting Word documents. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this tutorial will walk you through each step, ensuring you understand how to utilize this tool effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio 2019 or later.
2. .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.0 or later.
3. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Words for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming is essential.
5. A Valid License: Obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchase one from the [buy link](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project. This step is crucial as it ensures that you have access to all the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
using Aspose.Words.Charts;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Document and DocumentBuilder

To create and manipulate Word documents, we first need to initialize an instance of the `Document` class and a `DocumentBuilder` object.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

### Explanation

- Document doc: Creates a new instance of the Document class.
- DocumentBuilder builder: The DocumentBuilder helps in inserting content into the Document object.

## Step 2: Insert a Chart

Next, we'll insert a bar chart into the document using the `DocumentBuilder` object.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Bar, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

### Explanation

- Shape shape: Represents the chart as a shape in the document.
- builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Bar, 432, 252): Inserts a bar chart with specified dimensions.

## Step 3: Access the Chart Series

To customize the data labels, we first need to access the series in the chart.

```csharp
ChartSeries series0 = shape.Chart.Series[0];
```

### Explanation

- ChartSeries series0: Retrieves the first series of the chart, which we'll customize.

## Step 4: Customize Data Labels

Data labels can be customized to display various information. We'll configure the labels to show the legend key, series name, and value, while hiding the category name and percentage.

```csharp
ChartDataLabelCollection labels = series0.DataLabels;
labels.ShowLegendKey = true;
labels.ShowLeaderLines = true;
labels.ShowCategoryName = false;
labels.ShowPercentage = false;
labels.ShowSeriesName = true;
labels.ShowValue = true;
labels.Separator = "/";
```

### Explanation

- ChartDataLabelCollection labels: Accesses the data labels of the series.
- labels.ShowLegendKey: Displays the legend key.
- labels.ShowLeaderLines: Shows leader lines for data labels positioned far outside the data points.
- labels.ShowCategoryName: Hides the category name.
- labels.ShowPercentage: Hides the percentage value.
- labels.ShowSeriesName: Displays the series name.
- labels.ShowValue: Displays the value of the data points.
- labels.Separator: Sets the separator for the data labels.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.ChartDataLabel.docx");
```

### Explanation

- doc.Save: Saves the document with the specified name in the provided directory.
