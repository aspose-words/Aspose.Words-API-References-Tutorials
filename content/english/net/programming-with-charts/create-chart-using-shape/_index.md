## Introduction

Creating and customizing charts in your documents is a crucial skill in today's data-driven world. Charts can help to visualize data, making complex information more digestible. Aspose.Words for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to create and manipulate Word documents programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating and customizing a line chart using Aspose.Words for .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to create professional-looking charts with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Visual Studio: Any version that supports .NET.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics of C# will help you follow along with the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This step is essential as it allows you to use the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Words for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Document

First, you need to create a new Word document. This document will serve as the canvas for your chart.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Insert a Chart

Next, you will insert a line chart into the document. The `DocumentBuilder.InsertChart` method is used for this purpose.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Line, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

## Step 3: Customize the Chart Title

Customizing the chart title can help to provide context for the data being displayed. You can show the title and set its text using the following code:

```csharp
chart.Title.Show = true;
chart.Title.Text = "Line Chart Title";
chart.Title.Overlay = false;
// Please note if null or empty value is specified as title text, auto-generated title will be shown.
```

## Step 4: Adjust the Legend Position

The legend helps to identify different data series in your chart. You can customize its position and overlay settings like this:

```csharp
chart.Legend.Position = LegendPosition.Left;
chart.Legend.Overlay = true;
```

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, you need to save the document. This step ensures that all your changes are written to the file.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.CreateChartUsingShape.docx");
```
