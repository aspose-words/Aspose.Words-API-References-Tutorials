In this section, we'll explore how to create and customize charts using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Adding a Chart to a Document
To insert a chart into a Word document, follow these steps:

### Step 1.1: Initialize DocumentBuilder and Insert a Chart
```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

### Step 1.2: Configuring Chart Data
Next, configure the chart data by adding series and their respective data points:
```csharp
chart.Series.Clear();
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
    new string[] { "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5" },
    new double[] { 1.2, 0.3, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2 });
```

## Step 2: Adjusting Axis Properties
Now, let's customize the axis properties to control the appearance of our chart:

```csharp
chart.AxisX.TickLabelSpacing = 2;
```

## Step 3: Saving the Document
Finally, save the document with the inserted chart:
```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.IntervalUnitBetweenLabelsOnAxis.docx");
```
