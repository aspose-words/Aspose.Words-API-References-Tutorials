## Introduction

Hey there! Have you ever wanted to jazz up your Word documents with some snazzy charts? Well, you're in the right place! Today, we're diving into the world of Aspose.Words for .NET to customize single chart series in a chart. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, this guide will walk you through the entire process step by step. So, buckle up and let's get charting!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure we have everything we need. Here’s a quick checklist:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Visual Studio: Any recent version should do the trick.
3. A Basic Understanding of C#: Nothing too fancy, just the basics will do.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, we need to import the necessary namespaces. This is like setting the stage before the big show.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document

Let’s start by setting up a new Word document. This is where all the magic will happen.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Path to your document directory
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Insert a Chart

Next, we’ll insert a line chart into our document. Think of this as adding a canvas where we’ll paint our masterpiece.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Line, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

## Step 3: Access Chart Series

Now, let’s access the chart series. This is where we’ll start customizing.

```csharp
ChartSeries series0 = chart.Series[0];
ChartSeries series1 = chart.Series[1];
```

## Step 4: Rename Chart Series

Let’s give our chart series some meaningful names. This is like labeling your paintbrushes before you start painting.

```csharp
series0.Name = "Chart Series Name 1";
series1.Name = "Chart Series Name 2";
```

## Step 5: Smooth the Lines

Want those lines to look smooth and sleek? Let’s do that using Catmull-Rom splines.

```csharp
series0.Smooth = true;
series1.Smooth = true;
```

## Step 6: Handle Negative Values

Sometimes, data can be negative. Let’s make sure our chart handles that gracefully.

```csharp
series0.InvertIfNegative = true;
```

## Step 7: Customize Markers

Markers are like little dots on our lines. Let’s make them stand out.

```csharp
series0.Marker.Symbol = MarkerSymbol.Circle;
series0.Marker.Size = 15;
series1.Marker.Symbol = MarkerSymbol.Star;
series1.Marker.Size = 10;
```

## Step 8: Save Your Document

Finally, let’s save our document. This is where we admire our work.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.SingleChartSeries.docx");
```

And there you have it! You’ve successfully customized a single chart series in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. Pretty cool, right? This is just the tip of the iceberg; there’s so much more you can do with Aspose.Words. So, keep experimenting and creating awesome documents!
