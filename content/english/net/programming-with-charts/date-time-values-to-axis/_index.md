## Introduction

Creating charts in documents can be a powerful way to visualize data. When dealing with time series data, adding date and time values to the axis of a chart is crucial for clarity. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of adding date and time values to a chart's axis using Aspose.Words for .NET. This step-by-step guide will help you set up your environment, write the code, and understand each part of the process. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio or any .NET IDE: You need a development environment to write and run your .NET code.
2. Aspose.Words for .NET: You should have Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
3. Basic knowledge of C#: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming.
4. A valid Aspose license: You can obtain a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Import Namespaces

To begin, ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported in your project. This step is crucial for accessing the Aspose.Words classes and methods.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First, you need to define the directory where your document will be saved. This is important for organizing your files and ensuring your code runs correctly.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Create a New Document and DocumentBuilder

Next, create a new instance of the `Document` class and a `DocumentBuilder` object. These objects will help you build and manipulate your document.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 3: Insert a Chart into the Document

Now, insert a chart into your document using the `DocumentBuilder` object. In this example, we are using a column chart, but you can choose other types as well.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

## Step 4: Clear Existing Series

Clear any existing series in the chart to ensure you are starting with a blank slate. This step is essential for custom data.

```csharp
chart.Series.Clear();
```

## Step 5: Add Date and Time Values to the Series

Add your date and time values to the chart series. This step involves creating arrays for dates and corresponding values.

```csharp
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
    new[]
    {
        new DateTime(2017, 11, 06), new DateTime(2017, 11, 09), new DateTime(2017, 11, 15),
        new DateTime(2017, 11, 21), new DateTime(2017, 11, 25), new DateTime(2017, 11, 29)
    },
    new double[] { 1.2, 0.3, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2, 5.3 });
```

## Step 6: Configure the X-Axis

Set the scaling and tick marks for the X-axis. This ensures your dates are displayed correctly and at appropriate intervals.

```csharp
ChartAxis xAxis = chart.AxisX;
xAxis.Scaling.Minimum = new AxisBound(new DateTime(2017, 11, 05).ToOADate());
xAxis.Scaling.Maximum = new AxisBound(new DateTime(2017, 12, 03).ToOADate());
xAxis.MajorUnit = 7;
xAxis.MinorUnit = 1;
xAxis.MajorTickMark = AxisTickMark.Cross;
xAxis.MinorTickMark = AxisTickMark.Outside;
```

## Step 7: Save the Document

Finally, save your document to the specified directory. This step concludes the process, and your document should now contain a chart with date and time values on the X-axis.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.DateTimeValuesToAxis.docx");
```

## Conclusion

Adding date and time values to the axis of a chart in a document is a straightforward process with Aspose.Words for .NET. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can create clear and informative charts that effectively visualize time series data. Whether youâ€™re preparing reports, presentations, or any document requiring detailed data representation, Aspose.Words provides the tools you need to succeed.
