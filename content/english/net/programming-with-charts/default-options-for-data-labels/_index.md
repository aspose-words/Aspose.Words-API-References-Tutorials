## Introduction

Hey there! Are you excited to dive into the world of document automation? Today, we're going to explore how to use Aspose.Words for .NET to create stunning documents programmatically. Aspose.Words is a powerful library that allows you to manipulate Word documents with ease, and in this tutorial, we'll focus on setting default options for data labels in a chart. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newbie, this guide will walk you through each step to get you up and running in no time.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, let's make sure you have everything you need to follow along with this tutorial. Here's a quick checklist:

- Visual Studio or any other .NET compatible IDE: This is where you'll write and run your code.
- Aspose.Words for .NET: You can [download the latest version](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) and install it in your project.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming: While this guide is beginner-friendly, a little familiarity with C# will be helpful.
- .NET Framework installed: Ensure that you have the .NET Framework set up on your machine.
- A temporary license for Aspose.Words: Get one [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to unlock full functionality.

Once you've got these prerequisites sorted, we're ready to roll!

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's set up our project and import the necessary namespaces. These namespaces are crucial for accessing the Aspose.Words functionality.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.ReportingServices;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Document


The journey begins by creating a new document and initializing a `DocumentBuilder`. The `DocumentBuilder` class provides a set of methods to manipulate the document content easily.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Create a new document
Document doc = new Document();

// Initialize DocumentBuilder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

### Explanation

In this step, we've set up the document and the builder that we'll use to insert and format our content. The `dataDir` variable holds the path where we'll save our final document.

## Step 2: Insert a Chart

Next, we'll add a pie chart to our document. The `InsertChart` method of the `DocumentBuilder` class makes this super easy.

```csharp
// Insert a pie chart
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Pie, 432, 252);

// Access the chart object
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

### Explanation

Here, we're inserting a pie chart into our document. The `InsertChart` method requires the chart type, width, and height as parameters. After inserting the chart, we access the chart object to further manipulate it.

## Step 3: Customize the Chart Series

Now, we'll clear any existing series in the chart and add our custom series. This series will represent our data points.

```csharp
// Clear existing chart series
chart.Series.Clear();

// Add new series to the chart
ChartSeries series = chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
    new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3" },
    new double[] { 2.7, 3.2, 0.8 });
```

### Explanation

In this step, we're making sure our chart is empty by clearing any pre-existing series. Then, we add a new series with custom categories and values, which will be displayed in our pie chart.

## Step 4: Set Default Options for Data Labels

Data labels are crucial for making your chart informative. We'll set options to show percentage, value, and customize the separator.

```csharp
// Access the data labels collection
ChartDataLabelCollection labels = series.DataLabels;

// Set data label options
labels.ShowPercentage = true;
labels.ShowValue = true;
labels.ShowLeaderLines = false;
labels.Separator = " - ";
```

### Explanation

Here, we're accessing the `DataLabels` property of our series to customize the appearance and information displayed on each data label. We've chosen to show both the percentage and value, hide leader lines, and set a custom separator.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, we'll save our document to the specified directory. This step ensures that all our changes are written to a file.

```csharp
// Save the document
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.DefaultOptionsForDataLabels.docx");
```

### Explanation

In this last step, we save our document using the `Save` method. The document will be saved in the directory specified by `dataDir`, with the name "WorkingWithCharts.DefaultOptionsForDataLabels.docx".

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully created a Word document with a customized pie chart using Aspose.Words for .NET. This powerful library makes it easy to automate document creation and manipulation, saving you time and effort. Whether you're generating reports, invoices, or any other type of document, Aspose.Words has got you covered.
