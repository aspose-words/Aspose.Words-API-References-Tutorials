## Introduction

Charts are a powerful tool for visualizing data. When you need to create professional documents with dynamic charts, Aspose.Words for .NET is an invaluable library. This article will walk you through the process of defining XY axis properties in a chart using Aspose.Words for .NET, breaking down each step to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the coding, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: You need an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.
3. .NET Framework: Make sure your development environment is set up for .NET development.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming.

## Import Namespaces

To start with, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. This ensures you have access to all the classes and methods required for creating and manipulating documents and charts.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts;
```

We'll break down the process into simple steps, each focusing on a specific part of defining the XY axis properties in a chart.

## Step 1: Initialize the Document and DocumentBuilder

First, you need to initialize a new document and a `DocumentBuilder` object. The `DocumentBuilder` helps in inserting content into the document.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Insert a Chart

Next, you'll insert a chart into the document. In this example, we'll use an Area chart. You can customize the dimensions of the chart as needed.

```csharp
// Insert chart
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Area, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

## Step 3: Clear Default Series and Add Custom Data

By default, the chart will have some pre-defined series. We'll clear these and add our custom data series.

```csharp
chart.Series.Clear();
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
	new DateTime[]
	{
		new DateTime(2002, 01, 01), new DateTime(2002, 06, 01), new DateTime(2002, 07, 01),
		new DateTime(2002, 08, 01), new DateTime(2002, 09, 01)
	},
	new double[] { 640, 320, 280, 120, 150 });
```

## Step 4: Define the X Axis Properties

Now, it's time to define the properties for the X axis. This includes setting the category type, customizing the axis crossing, and adjusting tick marks and labels.

```csharp
ChartAxis xAxis = chart.AxisX;
xAxis.CategoryType = AxisCategoryType.Category;
xAxis.Crosses = AxisCrosses.Custom;
xAxis.CrossesAt = 3; // Measured in display units of the Y axis (hundreds).
xAxis.ReverseOrder = true;
xAxis.MajorTickMark = AxisTickMark.Cross;
xAxis.MinorTickMark = AxisTickMark.Outside;
xAxis.TickLabelOffset = 200;
```

## Step 5: Define the Y Axis Properties

Similarly, you will set the properties for the Y axis. This includes setting the tick label position, major and minor units, display unit, and scaling.

```csharp
ChartAxis yAxis = chart.AxisY;
yAxis.TickLabelPosition = AxisTickLabelPosition.High;
yAxis.MajorUnit = 100;
yAxis.MinorUnit = 50;
yAxis.DisplayUnit.Unit = AxisBuiltInUnit.Hundreds;
yAxis.Scaling.Minimum = new AxisBound(100);
yAxis.Scaling.Maximum = new AxisBound(700);
```

## Step 6: Save the Document

Finally, save the document to your specified directory. This will generate the Word document with the customized chart.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.DefineXYAxisProperties.docx");
```

## Conclusion

Creating and customizing charts in Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET is straightforward once you understand the steps involved. This guide has walked you through the process of defining XY axis properties in a chart, from initializing the document to saving the final product. With these skills, you can create detailed, professional-looking charts that enhance your documents.
