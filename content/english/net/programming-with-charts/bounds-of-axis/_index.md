## Introduction

Are you looking to create professional documents with charts in .NET? You’re in the right place! This guide will walk you through the process of using Aspose.Words for .NET to set the bounds of the axis in a chart. We'll break down each step to ensure you can follow along easily, even if you're new to the library. So, let's dive in and get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: You can [download](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) the latest version or use a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET installed on your system.
- IDE: A development environment like Visual Studio.

Once you have everything ready, we can move on to the next steps.

## Import Namespaces

To start, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. These will allow you to access the Aspose.Words library and its charting features.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, you need to set up the directory where your document will be saved. This is a simple step but crucial for organizing your files.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Create a New Document

Next, create a new document object. This document will serve as the container for your chart.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Document Builder

The DocumentBuilder class provides a quick and easy way to build documents. Initialize it with your document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 4: Insert a Chart

Now, it’s time to insert a chart into your document. In this example, we’ll use a Column chart.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

## Step 5: Clear Existing Series

To ensure that you start with a clean slate, clear any existing series from the chart.

```csharp
chart.Series.Clear();
```

## Step 6: Add Data to the Chart

Here, we add data to the chart. This includes specifying the series name and the data points.

```csharp
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
    new string[] { "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5" },
    new double[] { 1.2, 0.3, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2 });
```

## Step 7: Set Axis Bounds

Setting the bounds for the Y-axis ensures that your chart is scaled correctly.

```csharp
chart.AxisY.Scaling.Minimum = new AxisBound(0);
chart.AxisY.Scaling.Maximum = new AxisBound(6);
```

## Step 8: Save the Document

Finally, save your document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.BoundsOfAxis.docx");
```

And that’s it! You've successfully created a document with a chart using Aspose.Words for .NET.
