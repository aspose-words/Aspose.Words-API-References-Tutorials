// Define category names and data values
string[] categories = new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2" };
double[] dataValues1 = new double[] { 1, 2 };
double[] dataValues2 = new double[] { 3, 4 };

// Add data series to the chart
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 1", categories, dataValues1);
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 2", categories, dataValues2);
```

## Step 4: Save the Document
