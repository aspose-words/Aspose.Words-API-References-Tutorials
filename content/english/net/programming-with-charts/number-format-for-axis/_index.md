## Introduction

Hey there! Have you ever worked with charts in your documents and wished you could format the numbers on your axis to make them look more professional? Well, you're in luck! In this tutorial, we're going to dive deep into how you can achieve just that using Aspose.Words for .NET. This powerful library lets you handle Word documents in a way that's as easy as pie. And today, we’re focusing on giving those chart axes a makeover with custom number formats.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let’s make sure you’ve got everything you need. Here’s a quick checklist:

- Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have it installed. If not, you can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have a compatible .NET framework installed.
- Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio will work perfectly.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: This will help you follow along with the coding examples.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. This is like laying the foundation before building a house. Add the following using directives at the top of your code file:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words.Reporting;
```

Now, let’s break down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document

Heading: Initialize Your Document

First, you need to create a new document and a document builder. Think of this step as getting your canvas and brush ready before starting your masterpiece.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

Here, `dataDir` is the path to your document directory where you’ll save the final file. `Document` and `DocumentBuilder` are classes from Aspose.Words that help you create and manipulate Word documents.

## Step 2: Inserting a Chart

Heading: Add a Chart to Your Document

Next, let’s add a chart to your document. This is where the magic starts. We'll insert a column chart which will act as our blank canvas.

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
```

The `InsertChart` method inserts a chart of specified type (Column in this case) and dimensions into the document.

## Step 3: Customizing the Chart Series

Heading: Populate Your Chart with Data

Now, we need to add some data to our chart. This step is akin to filling your chart with meaningful information.

```csharp
chart.Series.Clear();
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
    new string[] { "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5" },
    new double[] { 1900000, 850000, 2100000, 600000, 1500000 });
```

Here, we’re adding a new series called "Aspose Series 1" with five data points. The `Series.Clear` method ensures any pre-existing data is removed before adding our new series.

## Step 4: Formatting the Axis Numbers

Heading: Beautify Your Axis Numbers

Finally, let’s format the numbers on the Y-axis to make them more readable. This is like putting the finishing touches on your artwork.

```csharp
chart.AxisY.NumberFormat.FormatCode = "#,##0";
```

The `FormatCode` property allows you to set a custom format for the numbers on the axis. In this example, `#,##0` ensures that large numbers are displayed with commas for thousands.

## Step 5: Saving the Document

Heading: Save Your Masterpiece

Now that everything is set up, it’s time to save your document. This step is the grand reveal of your work.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithCharts.NumberFormatForAxis.docx");
```

Here, the `Save` method saves the document to the specified path with the filename `WorkingWithCharts.NumberFormatForAxis.docx`.
