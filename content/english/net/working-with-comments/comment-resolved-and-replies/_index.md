## Introduction

If you're working with Word documents, you've probably dealt with comments. They're great for collaboration, but managing them can be a hassle. With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can automate the process of resolving and replying to comments. This guide will walk you through the steps to do just that.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up with .NET Framework.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with the syntax and concepts.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces. This ensures that all the classes and methods we need are readily available.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Comments;
```

Let's break down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps. Each step will help you understand the code and its functionality.

## Step 1: Load the Document

To begin, load the Word document containing the comments. Use the `Document` class for this.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Comments.docx");
```

This line of code initializes a new `Document` object with the path to your Word document.

## Step 2: Retrieve Comments

Next, we need to get all the comments in the document. We'll use the `GetChildNodes` method to retrieve a collection of `Comment` nodes.

```csharp
NodeCollection comments = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Comment, true);
```

This code retrieves all the comments in the document and stores them in a `NodeCollection`.

## Step 3: Access the Parent Comment

For our example, we'll focus on the first comment in the collection. This will be our parent comment.

```csharp
Comment parentComment = (Comment)comments[0];
```

Here, we're casting the first node in the collection to a `Comment` object.

## Step 4: Loop Through Replies

Now, let's loop through the replies to the parent comment. We'll use a `foreach` loop to iterate over each reply.

```csharp
foreach (Comment childComment in parentComment.Replies)
{
    Console.WriteLine(childComment.Ancestor.Id);
    Console.WriteLine(childComment.Done);

    childComment.Done = true;
}
```

In this loop, we print the ID of the ancestor comment and its status (whether it's done or not). Then, we mark each reply as done.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the modified document to your directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithComments.CommentResolvedAndReplies.docx");
```

This code saves the changes to a new document, ensuring your original file remains untouched.

## Conclusion

Handling comments in Word documents doesn't have to be a manual chore. With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can automate the process, saving time and reducing errors. Follow this guide to efficiently resolve and reply to comments in your documents.
