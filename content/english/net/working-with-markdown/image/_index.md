## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, let’s make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Any .NET development environment like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: If you’re familiar with C#, you’re good to go!

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let’s import the necessary namespaces. This is essential for accessing Aspose.Words classes and methods.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Drawing;
```

Now, let’s break down the process into simple steps. Each step will have a heading and a detailed explanation to make sure you’re following along smoothly.

## Step 1: Initialize DocumentBuilder

To start with, you need to create a `DocumentBuilder` object. This object will help you add content to your document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
```

## Step 2: Insert Image

Next, you’ll insert an image into your document. Here’s how you do it:

```csharp
Shape shape = builder.InsertImage("path_to_your_image.jpg");
```

Replace `"path_to_your_image.jpg"` with the actual path of your image file. The `InsertImage` method will add the image to your document.

## Step 3: Set Image Properties

You can set various properties for the image. For example, let’s set the title of the image:

```csharp
shape.ImageData.Title = "Your Image Title";
```
