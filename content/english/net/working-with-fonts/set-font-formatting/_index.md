## Introduction

Are you ready to dive into the world of document manipulation using Aspose.Words for .NET? Today, we're going to explore how to set font formatting in a Word document programmatically. This guide will take you through everything you need to know, from prerequisites to a detailed step-by-step tutorial. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details, let's ensure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: You should have a development environment set up, such as Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be beneficial.

## Import Namespaces

Before you start coding, ensure you import the necessary namespaces. This step is crucial as it allows you to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Words library.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
using System.Drawing;
```

Now, let's break down the process into simple, manageable steps.

## Step 1: Initialize Document and DocumentBuilder

First, you need to create a new document and initialize the `DocumentBuilder` class, which will help you build and format your document.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Initialize a new Document
Document doc = new Document();

// Initialize DocumentBuilder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Configure Font Properties

Next, you need to set the font properties such as bold, color, italic, name, size, spacing, and underline. This is where the magic happens.

```csharp
// Get the Font object from DocumentBuilder
Font font = builder.Font;

// Set font properties
font.Bold = true;
font.Color = Color.DarkBlue;
font.Italic = true;
font.Name = "Arial";
font.Size = 24;
font.Spacing = 5;
font.Underline = Underline.Double;
```

## Step 3: Write Formatted Text

With the font properties set, you can now write your formatted text into the document.

```csharp
// Write formatted text
builder.Writeln("I'm a very nice formatted string.");
```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, save the document to your specified directory. This step completes the process of setting font formatting.

```csharp
// Save the document
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.SetFontFormatting.docx");
```
