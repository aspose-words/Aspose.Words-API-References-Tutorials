## Introduction

If you’ve ever faced issues with fonts not rendering correctly in your documents, you’re not alone. Managing font settings and receiving notifications about font substitutions can save you a lot of headaches. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore how to handle font notifications using Aspose.Words for .NET, ensuring your documents always look their best.

## Prerequisites

Before we get into the details, make sure you have the following:

- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along.
- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: Download and install it from the [official download link](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: A setup like Visual Studio to write and execute your code.
- Sample Document: Have a sample document (e.g., `Rendering.docx`) ready to test the font settings.

## Import Namespaces

To start working with Aspose.Words, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This provides access to the classes and methods you’ll need.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Fonts;
using Aspose.Words.WarningInfo;
```

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

First, specify the directory where your document is stored. This is crucial for locating the document you want to process.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the Document

Load your document into an Aspose.Words `Document` object. This allows you to manipulate the document programmatically.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configure Font Settings

Now, configure the font settings to specify a default font that Aspose.Words should use if the required fonts are not found.

```csharp
FontSettings fontSettings = new FontSettings();
fontSettings.SubstitutionSettings.DefaultFontSubstitution.DefaultFontName = "Arial";

// Set Aspose.Words to look for fonts only in a non-existent folder
fontSettings.SetFontsFolder(string.Empty, false);
```

## Step 4: Set Up the Warning Callback

To capture and handle font substitution warnings, create a class that implements the `IWarningCallback` interface. This class will log any warnings that occur during document processing.

```csharp
public class HandleDocumentWarnings : IWarningCallback
{
    public void Warning(WarningInfo info)
    {
        // We are only interested in fonts being substituted.
        if (info.WarningType == WarningType.FontSubstitution)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Font substitution: " + info.Description);
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Assign the Callback and Font Settings to the Document

Assign the warning callback and the configured font settings to the document. This ensures that any font issues are captured and logged.

```csharp
HandleDocumentWarnings callback = new HandleDocumentWarnings();
doc.WarningCallback = callback;
doc.FontSettings = fontSettings;
```

## Step 6: Save the Document

Finally, save the document after applying the font settings and handling any font substitutions. Save it in a format of your choice; here, we’ll save it as a PDF.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.ReceiveNotificationsOfFonts.pdf");
```

By following these steps, you’ve configured your application to handle font substitutions gracefully and receive notifications whenever a substitution occurs.

## Conclusion

You’ve now mastered the process of receiving notifications for font substitutions using Aspose.Words for .NET. This skill will help you ensure that your documents always look their best, even when the necessary fonts aren’t available. Keep experimenting with different settings to fully leverage the power of Aspose.Words.
