## Introduction

Formatting the font in your Word documents can make a huge difference in how your content is perceived. Whether you're emphasizing a point, making your text more readable, or simply trying to match a style guide, font formatting is key. In this tutorial, we'll dive into how you can format fonts using Aspose.Words for .NET, a powerful library that makes handling Word documents a breeze.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other C# IDE.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the basics of C# programming will help you follow along with the examples.

## Import Namespaces

First, ensure you import the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document

To start, let's create a new document and set up a `DocumentBuilder`:

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Configuring the Font

Next, we'll configure the font properties. This includes setting the size, making the text bold, changing the color, specifying the font name, and adding an underline style:

```csharp
Font font = builder.Font;
font.Size = 16;
font.Bold = true;
font.Color = Color.Blue;
font.Name = "Arial";
font.Underline = Underline.Dash;
```

## Step 3: Writing the Text

With the font configured, we can now write some text into the document:

```csharp
builder.Write("Sample text.");
```

## Step 4: Saving the Document

Finally, save the document to your specified directory:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.FontFormatting.docx");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these simple steps, you can format fonts in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. This powerful library gives you fine-grained control over document formatting, allowing you to create professional and polished documents with ease.
