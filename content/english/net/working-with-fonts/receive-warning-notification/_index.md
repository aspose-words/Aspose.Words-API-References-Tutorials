## Introduction

Are you tired of dealing with unexpected font issues in your documents? With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can get notified of any potential issues during document processing, making it easier to maintain document quality. This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up warning notifications in Aspose.Words, ensuring that you never miss a crucial warning again.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following:

- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you understand and implement the steps.
- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: Download and install it from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- Development Environment: A setup like Visual Studio to write and run your code.
- Sample Document: Have a sample document (e.g., `Rendering.docx`) to work with.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces. These will provide access to the classes and methods required for our task.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.WarningInfo;
```

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

First, specify the directory where your document is stored. This is essential for locating the document you want to process.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the Document

Load your document into an Aspose.Words `Document` object. This allows you to manipulate the document programmatically.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Warning Callback

To capture and handle warnings, create a class that implements the `IWarningCallback` interface. This class will log any warnings that occur during document processing.

```csharp
public class HandleDocumentWarnings : IWarningCallback
{
    public void Warning(WarningInfo info)
    {
            Console.WriteLine("Font substitution: " + info.Description);
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Assign the Callback to the Document

Assign the warning callback to the document. This ensures that any font issues are captured and logged.

```csharp
HandleDocumentWarnings callback = new HandleDocumentWarnings();
doc.WarningCallback = callback;
```
## Step 5: Update Page Layout

Call the `UpdatePageLayout` method. This renders the document in memory and captures any warnings that occur during rendering.

```csharp
doc.UpdatePageLayout();
```

## Step 6: Save the Document

Finally, save the document. Even if the document was rendered previously, any save warnings will be notified to the user during this step.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.ReceiveWarningNotification.pdf");
```

By following these steps, you’ve configured your application to handle font substitutions gracefully and receive notifications whenever a substitution occurs.

## Conclusion

You’ve now mastered the process of receiving notifications for font substitutions using Aspose.Words for .NET. This skill will help you ensure that your documents always look their best, even when the necessary fonts aren’t available. Keep experimenting with different settings to fully leverage the power of Aspose.Words.
