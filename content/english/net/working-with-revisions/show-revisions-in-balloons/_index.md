## Introduction

Tracking changes in a Word document is crucial for collaboration and editing. Aspose.Words for .NET offers robust tools to manage these revisions, ensuring clarity and ease of review. This guide will help you display revisions in balloons, making it easier to see what changes have been made and by whom.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- A valid Aspose license. If you don't have one, you can get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET development.
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. These namespaces are essential for accessing the Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Layout;
using Aspose.Words.RevisionOptions;
```

Let's break down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 1: Load Your Document

First, we need to load the document that contains the revisions. Make sure your document path is correct.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Revisions.docx");
```

## Step 2: Configure Revision Options

Next, we'll configure the revision options to display insert revisions inline and delete and format revisions in balloons. This makes it easier to differentiate between different types of revisions.

```csharp
// Renders insert revisions inline, delete and format revisions in balloons.
doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.ShowInBalloons = ShowInBalloons.FormatAndDelete;
doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.MeasurementUnit = MeasurementUnits.Inches;
```

## Step 3: Set Revision Bars Position

To make the document even more readable, we can set the position of the revision bars. In this example, we'll place them on the right side of the page.

```csharp
// Renders revision bars on the right side of a page.
doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.RevisionBarsPosition = HorizontalAlignment.Right;
```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, we'll save the document as a PDF. This will allow us to see the revisions in the desired format.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithRevisions.ShowRevisionsInBalloons.pdf");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these simple steps, you can easily show revisions in balloons using Aspose.Words for .NET. This makes reviewing and collaborating on documents a breeze, ensuring that all changes are clearly visible and organized. Happy coding!
