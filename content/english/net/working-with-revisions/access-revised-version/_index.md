## Introduction

Have you ever needed to access the revised version of a document programmatically? Whether you're working on collaborative projects or simply need to manage document revisions, Aspose.Words for .NET is your go-to tool. This tutorial will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your environment to accessing and displaying revisions in a Word document. So, let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll need a few things:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET Library: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: This will help you follow along with the coding part.

Make sure you have these prerequisites sorted out before proceeding to the next steps.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This is a crucial step to ensure that your code recognizes the Aspose.Words for .NET library.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Lists;
```

Let's break down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document Path

Before you can work with the document, you need to specify the path where your document is located. This is essential for the code to find and manipulate the file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Loading the Document

Next, you'll load the document into your application. This step involves creating a new `Document` object and initializing it with the path to your document.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Revisions.docx");
```

## Step 3: Updating List Labels

If your document contains lists, it's important to update the list labels. This ensures that all list items are correctly numbered and formatted.

```csharp
doc.UpdateListLabels();
```

## Step 4: Switching to the Revised Version

Now, let's switch to the revised version of the document. This step is crucial if you want to access and display the revisions.

```csharp
doc.RevisionsView = RevisionsView.Final;
```

## Step 5: Iterating Through Revisions

To access the revisions, you'll need to iterate through the `Revisions` collection of the document. This step involves using a `foreach` loop to go through each revision.

```csharp
foreach (Revision revision in doc.Revisions)
{
    // Additional code will go here
}
```

## Step 6: Checking the Parent Node Type

For each revision, check if the parent node is of type `Paragraph`. This is important because we want to access the paragraph containing the revision.

```csharp
if (revision.ParentNode.NodeType == NodeType.Paragraph)
{
    // Additional code will go here
}
```

## Step 7: Accessing the Paragraph

Once you've confirmed that the parent node is a paragraph, cast it to a `Paragraph` object. This step allows you to work with the paragraph and its properties.

```csharp
Paragraph paragraph = (Paragraph)revision.ParentNode;
```

## Step 8: Checking If the Paragraph Is a List Item

Next, check if the paragraph is a list item. This is important because list items have specific properties that we need to access.

```csharp
if (paragraph.IsListItem)
{
    // Additional code will go here
}
```

## Step 9: Displaying the List Label and Level

Finally, display the list label and list level of the paragraph. This step provides useful information about the list item, such as its numbering and indentation level.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(paragraph.ListLabel.LabelString);
Console.WriteLine(paragraph.ListFormat.ListLevel);
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully accessed the revised version of a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. By following these steps, you can manage and display document revisions with ease. Whether you're dealing with collaborative projects or simply need to keep track of changes, Aspose.Words for .NET has got you covered.
