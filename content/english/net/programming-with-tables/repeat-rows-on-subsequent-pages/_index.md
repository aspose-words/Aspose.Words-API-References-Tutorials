## Introduction

Creating a Word document programmatically can be a daunting task, especially when you need to maintain the formatting across multiple pages. Have you ever tried making a table in Word, only to realize that your header rows aren't repeating on subsequent pages? Fear not! With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can easily ensure that your table headers repeat on each page, providing a professional and polished look to your documents. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to achieve this using simple code examples and detailed explanations. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. .NET Framework installed on your machine.
3. Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET development.
4. Basic understanding of C# programming.

Ensure you have installed Aspose.Words for .NET and set up your development environment before proceeding.

## Import Namespaces

To begin, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. Add the following using directives at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

These namespaces include the classes and methods required to manipulate Word documents and tables.

## Step 1: Initialize the Document

First, let's create a new Word document and a `DocumentBuilder` to construct our table.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory 
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

This code initializes a new document and a `DocumentBuilder` object, which helps in building the document structure.

## Step 2: Start the Table and Define Header Rows

Next, we'll start the table and define the header rows that we want to repeat on subsequent pages.

```csharp
builder.StartTable();
builder.RowFormat.HeadingFormat = true;
builder.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center;
builder.CellFormat.Width = 100;

builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("Heading row 1");
builder.EndRow();

builder.InsertCell();
builder.Writeln("Heading row 2");
builder.EndRow();
```

Here, we start a new table, set the `HeadingFormat` property to `true` to indicate that the rows are headers, and define the alignment and width of the cells.

## Step 3: Add Data Rows to the Table

Now, we'll add multiple data rows to our table. These rows will not repeat on subsequent pages.

```csharp
builder.CellFormat.Width = 50;
builder.ParagraphFormat.ClearFormatting();
for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
{
    builder.InsertCell();
    builder.RowFormat.HeadingFormat = false;
    builder.Write("Column 1 Text");
    
    builder.InsertCell();
    builder.Write("Column 2 Text");
    builder.EndRow();
}
```

This loop inserts 50 rows of data into the table, with two columns in each row. The `HeadingFormat` is set to `false` for these rows, as they are not header rows.

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, we save the document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTables.RepeatRowsOnSubsequentPages.docx");
```

This saves the document with the specified name in your document directory.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! With just a few lines of code, you can create a Word document with tables that have repeating header rows on subsequent pages using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only enhances the readability of your documents but also ensures a consistent and professional appearance. Now, go ahead and try this out in your projects!

## FAQ's

### Can I customize the header rows further?
Yes, you can apply additional formatting to the header rows by modifying the properties of `ParagraphFormat`, `RowFormat`, and `CellFormat`.

### Is it possible to add more columns to the table?
Absolutely! You can add as many columns as needed by inserting more cells within the `InsertCell` method.

### How can I make other rows repeat on subsequent pages?
To make any row repeat, set the `RowFormat.HeadingFormat` property to `true` for that specific row.

### Can I use this method for existing tables in a document?
Yes, you can modify existing tables by accessing them through the `Document` object and applying similar formatting.

### What other table formatting options are available in Aspose.Words for .NET?
Aspose.Words for .NET offers a wide range of table formatting options, including cell merging, border settings, and table alignment. Check out the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/) for more details.
