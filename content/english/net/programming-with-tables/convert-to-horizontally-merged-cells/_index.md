## Introduction

When working with tables in Word documents, you often need to manage cell merging to achieve a cleaner and more organized layout. Aspose.Words for .NET provides a powerful way to convert vertically merged cells to horizontally merged cells, ensuring your table looks just the way you want. In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let’s ensure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Words for .NET library. You can download it from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: A development environment like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces

First, we need to import the necessary namespaces for our project. This will allow us to utilize Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

Let's break down the process into simple steps to make it easy to follow.

## Step 1: Load Your Document

First, you need to load the document containing the table you want to modify. This document should already exist in your project directory.

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Load the document
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Table with merged cells.docx");
```

## Step 2: Access the Table

Next, we need to access the specific table within the document. Here, we're assuming the table is in the first section of the document.

```csharp
// Access the first table in the document
Table table = doc.FirstSection.Body.Tables[0];
```

## Step 3: Convert to Horizontally Merged Cells

Now, we will convert the vertically merged cells in the table to horizontally merged cells. This is done using the `ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells` method.

```csharp
// Convert vertically merged cells to horizontally merged cells
table.ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells();
```

## Conclusion

And that's it! You’ve successfully converted vertically merged cells to horizontally merged cells in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. This method ensures your tables are well-organized and easier to read. By following these steps, you can customize and manipulate your Word documents to meet your specific needs.
