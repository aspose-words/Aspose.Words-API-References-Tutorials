## Introduction

Combining rows from multiple tables into a single cohesive table can be a daunting task. But with Aspose.Words for .NET, it's a breeze! This guide will walk you through the entire process, making it easy for you to merge tables seamlessly. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, you'll find this tutorial invaluable. So, let's dive in and transform those scattered rows into a unified table.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the coding part, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. A Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET compatible IDE.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding of C# will be beneficial.

If you don't have Aspose.Words for .NET yet, you can get a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) or buy it [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). For any questions, the [support forum](https://forum.aspose.com/c/words/8) is a great place to start.

## Import Namespaces

First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This will allow you to access the Aspose.Words classes and methods. Here's how you do it:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Tables;
```

Now that we have everything set up, let's break down the process into easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 1: Load Your Document

The first step is to load your Word document. This document should contain the tables you want to combine. Here's the code to load a document:

```csharp
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Tables.docx");
```

In this example, replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the path to your document.

## Step 2: Identify the Tables

Next, you need to identify the tables you want to combine. Aspose.Words allows you to get tables from a document using the `GetChild` method. Here's how:

```csharp
Table firstTable = (Table) doc.GetChild(NodeType.Table, 0, true);
Table secondTable = (Table) doc.GetChild(NodeType.Table, 1, true);
```

In this code, we are fetching the first and second tables from the document.

## Step 3: Append Rows from Second Table to First Table

Now, it's time to combine the rows. We'll append all rows from the second table to the first table. This is done using a simple while loop:

```csharp
// Append all rows from the second table to the first table
while (secondTable.HasChildNodes)
    firstTable.Rows.Add(secondTable.FirstRow);
```

This loop continues until all rows from the second table are added to the first table.

## Step 4: Remove the Second Table

After appending the rows, the second table is no longer needed. You can remove it using the `Remove` method:

```csharp
secondTable.Remove();
```

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the modified document. This step ensures that your changes are written to the file:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTables.CombineRows.docx");
```

And that's it! You've successfully combined rows from two tables into one using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Conclusion

Combining rows from multiple tables into one can simplify your document processing tasks significantly. With Aspose.Words for .NET, this task becomes straightforward and efficient. By following this step-by-step guide, you can easily merge tables and streamline your workflow.
