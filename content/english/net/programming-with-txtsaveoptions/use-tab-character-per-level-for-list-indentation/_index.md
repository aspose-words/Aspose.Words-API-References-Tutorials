## Introduction

Lists are fundamental in organizing content, whether you're drafting a report, writing a research paper, or preparing a presentation. However, when it comes to presenting lists with multiple levels of indentation, achieving the desired format can be a bit tricky. Using Aspose.Words for .NET, you can easily manage list indentation and customize how each level is represented. In this tutorial, we'll focus on creating a list with multiple levels of indentation, using tab characters for precise formatting. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear understanding of how to set up and save your document with the correct indentation style.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the steps, ensure you have the following ready:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET Installed: You need the Aspose.Words library. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can download it from [Aspose Downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).

2. Basic Understanding of C# and .NET: Familiarity with C# programming and .NET framework is essential for following this tutorial.

3. Development Environment: Ensure you have an IDE or text editor to write and execute your C# code (e.g., Visual Studio).

4. Sample Document Directory: Set up a directory where you will save and test your document. 

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.Words in your .NET application. Add the following using directives at the beginning of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

In this section, we will create a multi-level list with tabbed indentation using Aspose.Words for .NET. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document

Create a New Document and DocumentBuilder

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Create a new document
Document doc = new Document();

// Initialize DocumentBuilder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

Here, we set up a new `Document` object and a `DocumentBuilder` to start creating content within the document.

## Step 2: Apply Default List Formatting

Create and Format the List

```csharp
// Apply default numbering style to the list
builder.ListFormat.ApplyNumberDefault();
```

In this step, we apply the default numbering format to our list. This will help in creating a numbered list that we can then customize.

## Step 3: Add List Items with Different Levels

Insert List Items and Indent

```csharp
// Add the first list item
builder.Write("Element 1");

// Indent to create the second level
builder.ListFormat.ListIndent();
builder.Write("Element 2");

// Indent further to create the third level
builder.ListFormat.ListIndent();
builder.Write("Element 3");
```

Here, we add three elements to our list, each with increasing levels of indentation. The `ListIndent` method is used to increase the indentation level for each subsequent item.

## Step 4: Configure Save Options

Set Indentation to Use Tab Characters

```csharp
// Configure save options to use tab characters for indentation
TxtSaveOptions saveOptions = new TxtSaveOptions();
saveOptions.ListIndentation.Count = 1;
saveOptions.ListIndentation.Character = '\t';
```

We configure the `TxtSaveOptions` to use tab characters for indentation in the saved text file. The `ListIndentation.Character` property is set to `'\t'`, which represents a tab character.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Save the Document with Specified Options

```csharp
// Save the document with the specified options
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTxtSaveOptions.UseTabCharacterPerLevelForListIndentation.txt", saveOptions);
```

Finally, we save the document using the `Save` method with our custom `TxtSaveOptions`. This ensures that the list is saved with tab characters for indentation levels.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve walked through creating a multi-level list with tabbed indentation using Aspose.Words for .NET. By following these steps, you can easily manage and format lists in your documents, ensuring that they are presented clearly and professionally. Whether you’re working on reports, presentations, or any other document type, these techniques will help you achieve precise control over your list formatting.

## FAQ's

### How can I change the indentation character from a tab to a space?
You can modify the `saveOptions.ListIndentation.Character` property to use a space character instead of a tab.

### Can I apply different list styles to different levels?
Yes, Aspose.Words allows customization of list styles at various levels. You can modify list formatting options to achieve different styles.

### What if I need to apply bullet points instead of numbers?
Use the `ListFormat.ApplyBulletDefault()` method instead of `ApplyNumberDefault()` to create a bulleted list.

### How can I adjust the size of the tab character used for indentation?
Unfortunately, the tab size in `TxtSaveOptions` is fixed. To adjust indentation size, you might need to use spaces or customize the list formatting directly.

### Can I use these settings when exporting to other formats like PDF or DOCX?
The specific tab character settings apply to text files. For formats like PDF or DOCX, you would need to adjust formatting options within those formats.
