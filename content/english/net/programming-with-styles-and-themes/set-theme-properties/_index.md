In this tutorial, we will explore the provided C# source code to set the theme properties of a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We are going to change the secondary fonts and theme colors.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

```

In this step, we access the `Theme` object of the `Document` object to get the document theme. Next, we can modify theme properties such as secondary fonts (`MinorFonts.Latin`) and colors (`Colors.Hyperlink`).

## Step 4: Save the document
