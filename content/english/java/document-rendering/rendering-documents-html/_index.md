## Introduction to Rendering Documents to HTML

In the digital age, document rendering is a crucial aspect of content management. Whether you are creating reports, generating web content, or simply converting documents for online viewing, having a reliable tool at your disposal can make all the difference. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful API that allows you to render documents to HTML with ease. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to achieve this using Aspose.Words for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the details, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Words for Java API: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).
- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step process.

## Step 1: Setting up your Java Project

First, create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Make sure to include the Aspose.Words for Java library in your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Loading the Document

To begin rendering a document to HTML, you need to load the document using Aspose.Words. Here's a simple code snippet to get you started:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

public class DocumentRenderer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the document
        Document doc = new Document("path/to/your/document.docx");
    }
}
```

Replace `"path/to/your/document.docx"` with the actual path to your document.

## Step 3: Rendering to HTML

Now that you have loaded the document, it's time to render it to HTML. Aspose.Words makes this process straightforward:

```java
import com.aspose.words.HtmlSaveOptions;

public class DocumentRenderer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the document
        Document doc = new Document("path/to/your/document.docx");
        
        // Set up HTML save options
        HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions();
        saveOptions.setPrettyFormat(true);
        
        // Save the document as HTML
        doc.save("path/to/output/document.html", saveOptions);
    }
}
```

This code will save your document in HTML format. You can customize the HTML output further by adjusting the `HtmlSaveOptions` as needed.

## Step 4: Running the Code

Compile and run your Java code. Upon successful execution, you will find the HTML version of your document in the specified output path.
