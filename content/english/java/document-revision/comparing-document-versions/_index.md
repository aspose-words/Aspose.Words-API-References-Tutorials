## Introduction

Document comparison involves analyzing two or more versions of a document to identify differences and similarities. Aspose.Words for Java provides the tools to perform this task efficiently. In this guide, we will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your development environment to saving the compared document.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into document comparison, you need to set up your development environment. Make sure you have Aspose.Words for Java installed. You can download it from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

## Loading Documents

To compare document versions, you first need to load the documents you want to analyze. Aspose.Words for Java makes this easy with its robust document loading capabilities.

```java
// Load the original document
Document originalDocument = new Document("original.docx");

// Load the revised document
Document revisedDocument = new Document("revised.docx");
```

## Comparing Document Versions

Now that we have our documents loaded, let's proceed with the comparison. Aspose.Words for Java provides a straightforward method for this.

```java
// Compare the documents
DocumentComparer comparer = new DocumentComparer(originalDocument, revisedDocument);
comparer.compare();
```

## Identifying Changes

After the comparison, it's essential to identify the changes made between the two documents. Aspose.Words for Java helps us retrieve this information.

```java
// Get the list of changes
List<DocumentChange> changes = comparer.getChanges();
```

## Applying Changes

Once you have identified the changes, you can choose to apply them selectively or all at once to one of the documents.

```java
// Apply changes to the original document
comparer.applyChangesToOriginalDocument();
```

## Saving the Compared Document

After applying changes, it's time to save the compared document for further use.

```java
// Save the compared document
originalDocument.save("compared_document.docx");
```

## Conclusion

Comparing document versions is a critical task in many scenarios, and Aspose.Words for Java simplifies this process. With its robust API, you can efficiently load, compare, identify changes, apply them, and save the compared document. This guide has provided a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire process.
