## Getting Started with Aspose.Words for Java

Before we dive into the details of tracking and managing document revisions, let's start by getting familiar with Aspose.Words for Java.

### What is Aspose.Words for Java?

Aspose.Words for Java is a robust and feature-rich Java library that allows developers to work with Word documents programmatically. It provides the capability to create, edit, convert, and manipulate Word documents with ease. With its comprehensive set of features, it's the perfect tool for document revision management.

### Installing Aspose.Words for Java

### Creating Your First Document

Let's start with a simple example of creating a new Word document using Aspose.Words for Java. In this example, we'll create a document and add some text to it.

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;
import com.aspose.words.Paragraph;

public class DocumentCreationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a new document
        Document doc = new Document();
        
        // Add a paragraph with some text
        Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(doc);
        paragraph.appendChild(new Run(doc, "Hello, Aspose.Words!"));
        doc.appendChild(paragraph);
        
        // Save the document
        doc.save("MyDocument.docx");
    }
}
```

This simple code creates a new Word document and adds a "Hello, Aspose.Words!" message to it. You can run this code in your Java environment to create your first document.

## Tracking Document Revisions

One of the key features of Aspose.Words for Java is its ability to track document revisions. This is particularly useful when multiple users are collaborating on a document, and you need to keep track of changes made by each user.

### Enabling Revision Tracking

To enable revision tracking in a Word document using Aspose.Words for Java, you can use the `TrackRevisions` property. Here's an example of how to enable revision tracking:

```java
Document doc = new Document("MyDocument.docx");

// Enable revision tracking
doc.startTrackRevisions("John Doe");
```

In this example, we open an existing document and start tracking revisions with the author's name "John Doe." Any changes made to the document after this point will be tracked as revisions.

### Accepting or Rejecting Revisions

Once revisions are tracked, you can programmatically accept or reject them using Aspose.Words for Java. Here's an example of how to accept all revisions in a document:

```java
Document doc = new Document("MyDocument.docx");

// Accept all revisions
doc.acceptAllRevisions();
```

This code accepts all revisions in the document, effectively applying the changes to the main document.

## Managing Document Versions

In addition to tracking revisions, Aspose.Words for Java allows you to manage document versions effectively. You can create and maintain different versions of a document, which is especially valuable for document history and auditing.

### Creating Document Versions

To create a new version of a document, you can make a copy of the document with a new name or version number. Here's an example:

```java
// Create a new version of the document
doc.save("MyDocument_v2.docx");
```

In this example, we save a copy of the document with the "_v2" suffix to indicate it's a new version. You can follow a similar approach to create different versions as needed.
