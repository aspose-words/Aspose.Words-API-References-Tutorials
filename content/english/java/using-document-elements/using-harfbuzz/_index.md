Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Word documents in Java applications. It provides various features to manipulate and generate Word documents, including text shaping. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will explore how to use HarfBuzz for text shaping in Aspose.Words for Java.

## Introduction to HarfBuzz

HarfBuzz is an open-source text shaping engine that supports complex scripts and languages. It is widely used for rendering text in various languages, especially those that require advanced text shaping features, such as Arabic, Persian, and Indic scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Words for Java library installed.
- Java development environment set up.
- Sample Word document for testing.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

To get started, create a new Java project and include the Aspose.Words for Java library in your project dependencies.

## Step 2: Loading a Word Document

In this step, we'll load a sample Word document that we want to work with. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your Word document:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "SampleDocument.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configuring Text Shaping with HarfBuzz

To enable HarfBuzz text shaping, we need to set the text shaper factory in the document's layout options:

```java
// Enable HarfBuzz text shaping
doc.getLayoutOptions().setTextShaperFactory(HarfBuzzTextShaperFactory.getInstance());
```

## Step 4: Saving the Document

Now that we have configured HarfBuzz text shaping, we can save the document. Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the desired output directory and filename:

```java
String outPath = "Your Output Directory";
doc.save(outPath + "ShapedDocument.pdf");
```

## Complete Source Code
```java
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "OpenType text shaping.docx");
// When we set the text shaper factory, the layout starts to use OpenType features.
// An Instance property returns BasicTextShaperCache object wrapping HarfBuzzTextShaperFactory.
doc.getLayoutOptions().setTextShaperFactory(HarfBuzzTextShaperFactory.getInstance());
doc.save(outPath + "WorkingWithHarfBuzz.OpenTypeFeatures.pdf");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use HarfBuzz for text shaping in Aspose.Words for Java. By following these steps, you can enhance your Word document processing capabilities and ensure proper rendering of complex scripts and languages.
