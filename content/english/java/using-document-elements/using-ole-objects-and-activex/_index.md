In this tutorial, we will explore how to work with OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects and ActiveX controls in Aspose.Words for Java. OLE objects and ActiveX controls are powerful tools that allow you to enhance your documents by embedding or linking external content, such as spreadsheets, multimedia files, or interactive controls. Follow along as we delve into the code examples and learn how to use these features effectively.

### Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Words for Java : Ensure you have the Aspose.Words library installed in your Java project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

2. Java Development Environment : You should have a working Java development environment set up on your system.

### Inserting an OLE Object

Let's begin by inserting an OLE object into a Word document. We'll create a simple Word document and then insert an OLE object representing a web page.

```java
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";
public void insertOleObject() throws Exception
{
    Document doc = new Document();
    DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
    builder.insertOleObject("http://www.aspose.com", "htmlfile", true, true, null);
    doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "WorkingWithOleObjectsAndActiveX.InsertOleObject.docx");
}
```

In this code, we create a new document and insert an OLE object that displays the Aspose website. You can replace the URL with the desired content.

### Inserting an OLE Object with OlePackage

Next, let's explore how to insert an OLE object using an OlePackage. This allows you to embed external files as OLE objects in your document.

```java
@Test
public void insertOleObjectWithOlePackage() throws Exception
{
    Document doc = new Document();
    DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
    byte[] bs = FileUtils.readFileToByteArray(new File("Your Directory Path" + "Zip file.zip"));
    try (ByteArrayInputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(bs))
    {
        Shape shape = builder.insertOleObject(stream, "Package", true, null);
        OlePackage olePackage = shape.getOleFormat().getOlePackage();
        olePackage.setFileName("filename.zip");
        olePackage.setDisplayName("displayname.zip");
        doc.save(outPath + "WorkingWithOleObjectsAndActiveX.InsertOleObjectWithOlePackage.docx");
    }
}
```

In this example, we insert an OLE object using an OlePackage, allowing you to include external files as embedded objects.

### Inserting an OLE Object as an Icon

Now, let's see how to insert an OLE object as an icon. This is useful when you want to display an icon representing an embedded file.

```java
@Test
public void insertOleObjectAsIcon() throws Exception
{
    Document doc = new Document();
    DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
    builder.insertOleObjectAsIcon("Your Directory Path" + "Presentation.pptx", false, getImagesDir() + "Logo icon.ico", "My embedded file");
    doc.save(outPath + "WorkingWithOleObjectsAndActiveX.InsertOleObjectAsIcon.docx");
}
```

In this code, we insert an OLE object as an icon, providing a more visually appealing representation of the embedded content.

### Reading ActiveX Control Properties

Now, let's shift our focus to ActiveX controls. We'll learn how to read properties of ActiveX controls within a Word document.

```java
@Test
public void readActiveXControlProperties() throws Exception
{
    Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "ActiveX controls.docx");
    String properties = "";
    for (Shape shape : (Iterable<Shape>) doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.SHAPE, true))
    {
        if (shape.getOleFormat() == null) break;
        OleControl oleControl = shape.getOleFormat().getOleControl();
        if (oleControl.isForms2OleControl())
        {
            Forms2OleControl checkBox = (Forms2OleControl) oleControl;
            properties = properties + "\nCaption: " + checkBox.getCaption();
            properties = properties + "\nValue: " + checkBox.getValue();
            properties = properties + "\nEnabled: " + checkBox.getEnabled();
            properties = properties + "\nType: " + checkBox.getType();
            if (checkBox.getChildNodes() != null)
            {
                properties = properties + "\nChildNodes: " + checkBox.getChildNodes();
            }
            properties += "\n";
        }
    }
    properties = properties + "\nTotal ActiveX Controls found: " + doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.SHAPE, true).getCount();
    System.out.println("\n" + properties);
}
```

In this code, we iterate through the shapes in a Word document, identify ActiveX controls, and retrieve their properties.
