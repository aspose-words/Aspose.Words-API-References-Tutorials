Whether you're a seasoned Java developer or just starting your coding journey, this guide will walk you through the process of extracting document content by pages, providing you with a valuable skillset for various applications.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we can start working with Aspose.Words for Java, we need to set up our development environment. Follow these steps:

1. Install Java: If you don't have Java installed, download and install the latest version from the official website.

2. Download Aspose.Words for Java: Head over to [Aspose.Words for Java](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/) and download the latest version of the library.

3. Integrate Aspose.Words into Your Project: Add the Aspose.Words JAR files to your Java project's classpath.

### Creating a New Java Project

Now, let's create a new Java project to kickstart our journey:

```java
public class DocumentExtractor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

### Adding Aspose.Words to Your Project

To add Aspose.Words to your project, copy the downloaded JAR files to your project's `lib` folder and add them to your classpath. You're now ready to dive into the world of document extraction!

## Loading and Parsing Documents

### Loading a Word Document

Let's start by loading a Word document:

```java
// Load the document
Document doc = new Document("sample.docx");
```

### Parsing the Document Structure

Now that we have our document loaded, let's parse its structure:

```java
// Create a DocumentVisitor
DocumentVisitor visitor = new DocumentVisitor();

// Traverse the document
doc.accept(visitor);

// Extracted content is now available in the visitor
String extractedText = visitor.getText();
```

## Extracting Content by Pages

### What are Document Pages?

In Aspose.Words, a document can be divided into pages. Each page represents a portion of the document's content. But how do we access these pages programmatically?

### Extracting Text from a Specific Page

```java
// Specify the page number (zero-based index)
int pageNumber = 0;

// Extract text from the specified page
PageInfo pageInfo = doc.getPageInfo(pageNumber);
String pageText = doc.extractText(pageInfo);
```

### Looping Through All Pages

To extract content from all pages, you can use a simple loop:

```java
// Get the total number of pages in the document
int pageCount = doc.getPageCount();

for (int i = 0; i < pageCount; i++) {
    PageInfo pageInfo = doc.getPageInfo(i);
    String pageText = doc.extractText(pageInfo);
    // Process the extracted content as needed
}
```

## Manipulating Extracted Content

### Formatting and Styling Text

You can apply formatting and styling to the extracted text, just like you would with any other text in Java. For example, to make text bold:

```java
// Create a DocumentBuilder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert formatted text
builder.getFont().setBold(true);
builder.write("This text is bold.");
```

### Saving Extracted Content to a New Document

Once you've extracted and manipulated the content, you can save it to a new document:

```java
// Save the extracted content to a new document
doc.save("extracted_content.docx");
```
