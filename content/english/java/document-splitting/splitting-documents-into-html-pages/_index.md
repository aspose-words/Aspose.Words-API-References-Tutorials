In this comprehensive guide, we will explore how to split documents into HTML pages using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words is a powerful Java API that allows developers to work with Word documents programmatically. We will walk you through the process step by step, providing source code examples along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Words for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).


## Introduction

In today's digital world, converting Word documents into HTML pages is a common requirement. Aspose.Words simplifies this task by providing a Java API that allows us to split Word documents into HTML pages effortlessly. Let's get started.

## Setting up the Project

To begin, create a Java project and add the Aspose.Words for Java library to your project's classpath. You can do this by including the JAR files you downloaded earlier.

## Loading a Word Document

In your Java code, you'll first need to load the Word document you want to split. Here's an example of how to do it:

```java
Document doc = new Document("your-document.docx");
```

Replace `"your-document.docx"` with the path to your Word document.

## Splitting the Document

Now, let's split the document into HTML pages. Aspose.Words makes this task straightforward:

```java
DocumentSplitOptions splitOptions = new DocumentSplitOptions();
splitOptions.setDocumentSplitCriteria(DocumentSplitCriteria.PAGE_BREAK);

List<Document> pages = DocumentSplitter.split(doc, splitOptions);
```

This code splits the document based on page breaks and stores each page in the `pages` list.

## Saving as HTML

Next, you can save each page as an HTML file:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < pages.size(); i++) {
    pages.get(i).save("page" + i + ".html", SaveFormat.HTML);
}
```

This code iterates through the pages and saves them as HTML files.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've learned how to split Word documents into HTML pages using Aspose.Words for Java. This powerful API simplifies the process, making it easy to work with Word documents programmatically.

Now, you can convert your Word documents into HTML pages with ease, making them accessible and shareable online.
