## Introduction

Creating tables dynamically from data sources is a common task in many applications. Whether you're generating reports, invoices, or data summaries, being able to populate a table with data programmatically can save you a lot of time and effort. In this tutorial, we will explore how to generate a table from a DataTable using Aspose.Words for Java. We’ll break down the process into manageable steps, ensuring you have a clear understanding of each part.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, let’s ensure you have everything you need to get started:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
   
2. Aspose.Words for Java: You will need the Aspose.Words library. You can download the latest version from [Aspose's releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

3. IDE: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will make coding easier.

4. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming concepts will help you understand the code snippets better.

5. Sample Data: For this tutorial, we’ll use an XML file named "List of people.xml" to simulate a data source. You can create this file with sample data for testing.

## Step 1: Create a New Document

First, we need to create a new document where our table will reside. This is the canvas for our work.

```java
Document doc = new Document();
```

Here, we instantiate a new `Document` object. This will serve as our working document where we will build our table.

## Step 2: Initialize DocumentBuilder

Next, we will use the `DocumentBuilder` class, which allows us to manipulate the document more easily.

```java
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

The `DocumentBuilder` object provides methods to insert tables, text, and other elements into the document.

## Step 3: Set Page Orientation

Since we expect our table to be wide, we will set the page orientation to landscape.

```java
doc.getFirstSection().getPageSetup().setOrientation(Orientation.LANDSCAPE);
```

This step is crucial because it ensures that our table fits nicely on the page without being cut off.

## Step 4: Load Data from XML

Now, we need to load our data from the XML file into a `DataTable`. This is where our data comes from.

```java
DataSet ds = new DataSet();
ds.readXml(getMyDir() + "List of people.xml");
DataTable dataTable = ds.getTables().get(0);
```

Here, we read the XML file and retrieve the first table from the dataset. This `DataTable` will hold the data we want to display in our document.

## Step 5: Import the Table from DataTable

Now comes the exciting part: importing our data into the document as a table.

```java
Table table = importTableFromDataTable(builder, dataTable, true);
```

We call the method `importTableFromDataTable`, passing the `DocumentBuilder`, our `DataTable`, and a boolean to indicate whether to include column headings.

## Step 6: Style the Table

Once we have our table, we can apply some styling to make it look good.

```java
table.setStyleIdentifier(StyleIdentifier.MEDIUM_LIST_2_ACCENT_1);
table.setStyleOptions(TableStyleOptions.FIRST_ROW | TableStyleOptions.ROW_BANDS | TableStyleOptions.LAST_COLUMN);
```

This code applies a predefined style to the table, enhancing its visual appeal and readability.

## Step 7: Remove Unwanted Cells

If you have any columns that you don’t want to display, such as an image column, you can easily remove it.

```java
table.getFirstRow().getLastCell().removeAllChildren();
```

This step ensures that our table only shows the relevant information.

## Step 8: Save the Document

Finally, we save our document with the generated table.

```java
doc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "WorkingWithTables.BuildTableFromDataTable.docx");
```

This line saves the document in the specified directory, allowing you to review the results.

## The importTableFromDataTable Method

Let’s take a closer look at the `importTableFromDataTable` method. This method is responsible for creating the table structure and populating it with data.

### Step 1: Start the Table

First, we need to start a new table in the document.

```java
Table table = builder.startTable();
```

This initializes a new table in our document.

### Step 2: Add Column Headings

If we want to include column headings, we check the `importColumnHeadings` flag.

```java
if (importColumnHeadings) {
    // Store original formatting
    boolean boldValue = builder.getFont().getBold();
    int paragraphAlignmentValue = builder.getParagraphFormat().getAlignment();

    // Set heading formatting
    builder.getFont().setBold(true);
    builder.getParagraphFormat().setAlignment(ParagraphAlignment.CENTER);

    // Insert column names
    for (DataColumn column : dataTable.getColumns()) {
        builder.insertCell();
        builder.writeln(column.getColumnName());
    }

    builder.endRow();

    // Restore original formatting
    builder.getFont().setBold(boldValue);
    builder.getParagraphFormat().setAlignment(paragraphAlignmentValue);
}
```

This block of code formats the heading row and inserts the names of the columns from the `DataTable`.

### Step 3: Populate the Table with Data

Now, we loop through each row of the `DataTable` to insert data into the table.

```java
for (DataRow dataRow : (Iterable<DataRow>) dataTable.getRows()) {
    for (Object item : dataRow.getItemArray()) {
        builder.insertCell();
        switch (item.getClass().getName()) {
            case "DateTime":
                Date dateTime = (Date) item;
                SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("MMMM d, yyyy");
                builder.write(simpleDateFormat.format(dateTime));
                break;
            default:
                builder.write(item.toString());
                break;
        }
    }
    builder.endRow();
}
```

In this section, we handle different data types, formatting dates appropriately while inserting other data as text.

### Step 4: End the Table

Finally, we finish the table once all data has been inserted.

```java
builder.endTable();
```

This line marks the end of our table, allowing the `DocumentBuilder` to know that we are done with this section.
