## Introduction

Aspose.Words for Java is a robust API that empowers Java developers to work with various aspects of document processing. In this guide, we will focus on managing document lists, a fundamental task in document automation.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Words for Java

Before we dive into the specifics of working with document lists, let's make sure you have everything set up correctly:

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Words for Java library downloaded and added to your project.

## Creating a Document List

To create a document list, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary packages.
2. Initialize a Document object.
3. Add list items to the document.
4. Save the document.

Here's a sample code snippet to get you started:

```java
// Import required packages
import com.aspose.words.*;

List list = doc.getLists().add(ListTemplate.NUMBER_DEFAULT);
builder.getListFormat().setList(list);
builder.writeln("Item 1");
builder.writeln("Item 2");
builder.writeln("Item 3");
```

## Modifying a Document List

Once you have created a document list, you may need to modify it by adding, removing, or updating list items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Load an existing document.
2. Access the list you want to modify.
3. Perform the desired operations.
4. Save the document.

Here's a code snippet for modifying a document list:

```java
Paragraph lastListParagraph = null;
NodeCollection paragraphs = doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.PARAGRAPH, true);
for (Paragraph paragraph : (Iterable<Paragraph>) paragraphs) {
    // Check if the paragraph is part of a list.
    if (paragraph.isListItem()) {
        // Update the last list paragraph.
        lastListParagraph = paragraph;
    }
}

builder.moveTo(lastListParagraph);
builder.writeln("Item 4");
```

## Extracting Information from a Document List

In some cases, you may need to extract information from a document list, such as retrieving all list items or specific items based on criteria. Here's how you can do it:

1. Load the document containing the list.
2. Access the list.
3. Iterate through the list items and extract the desired information.

Here's a code snippet for extracting information from a document list:

```java
NodeCollection paragraphs = doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.PARAGRAPH, true);
for (Paragraph paragraph : (Iterable<Paragraph>) paragraphs) {
    if (paragraph.isListItem()) {
        builder.moveTo(paragraph);
        builder.writeln("Item 4");
    }
}
```
