In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of applying licensing to Aspose.Words for Java. Licensing is essential to unlock the full potential of Aspose.Words and ensure that your application can use it without any limitations. We'll provide you with the necessary source code and guide you on how to set up licensing effectively.

## 1. Introduction to Licensing in Aspose.Words for Java

Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing library that allows you to create, edit, and manipulate Word documents programmatically. To use it effectively, you need to apply a valid license. Without a license, Aspose.Words operates in a trial mode with limitations.

## 2. Obtaining a License

Before you can apply a license, you need to obtain one. Aspose offers various licensing options, including temporary and permanent licenses. To get a license, visit the [Aspose Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## 3. Setting Up Your Development Environment

To begin, make sure you have Aspose.Words for Java installed in your development environment. You can download it from the [Aspose Downloads Page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/). Once installed, you can start coding.

## 4. Applying the License

Now, let's apply the license to your Aspose.Words for Java application. You'll need the following source code:

```java
License license = new License();
try {
    license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
    System.out.println("License set successfully.");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

This code initializes the license and attempts to set it. Ensure that you replace `"Aspose.Words.lic"` with the path to your license file.

## 5. Handling Licensing Exceptions

It's important to handle licensing exceptions gracefully. If there's an issue with the license file, you'll receive an exception. You can customize error handling according to your application's needs.

## 6. Testing Your Licensed Aspose.Words Application

After applying the license, test your Aspose.Words application thoroughly to ensure that all features work as expected. This step is crucial to guarantee that your documents are generated without any trial limitations.
## Complete Source Code
```java
        License license = new License();
        // This line attempts to set a license from several locations relative to the executable and Aspose.Words.dll.
        // You can also use the additional overload to load a license from a stream, this is useful,
        // for instance, when the license is stored as an embedded resource.
        try
        {
            license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
            System.out.println("License set successfully.");
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // We do not ship any license with this example,
            // visit the Aspose site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. 
            System.out.println("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.getMessage());
        }
```
Apply License from stream

```java		
    public void applyLicenseFromStream() throws Exception
    {
        License license = new License();
        try
        {
            license.setLicense(new FileInputStream(new File("Aspose.Words.lic")));
            System.out.println("License set successfully.");
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // We do not ship any license with this example,
            // visit the Aspose site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. 
            System.out.println("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
```	
Apply Metered license
	
```java	
    public void applyMeteredLicense() {
        try
        {
            Metered metered = new Metered();
            metered.setMeteredKey("### ***", "***");
            Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Document.docx");
            System.out.println(doc.getPageCount());
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.getMessage());
        }
```
