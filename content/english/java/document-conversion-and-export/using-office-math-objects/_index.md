## Introduction to Using Office Math Objects in Aspose.Words for Java

In the realm of document processing in Java, Aspose.Words stands as a reliable and powerful tool. One of its lesser-known gems is the ability to work with Office Math objects. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into how to leverage Office Math objects in Aspose.Words for Java to manipulate and display mathematical equations within your documents. 

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the intricacies of working with Office Math in Aspose.Words for Java, let's make sure you have everything set up. Ensure that you have:

- Installed Aspose.Words for Java.
- A document containing Office Math equations (for this guide, we'll use "OfficeMath.docx").

## Understanding Office Math Objects

Office Math objects are used to represent mathematical equations within a document. Aspose.Words for Java provides robust support for Office Math, allowing you to control their display and formatting. 

## Step by Step Guide

Let's get started with the step-by-step process of working with Office Math in Aspose.Words for Java:

### Step 1: Load the Document

First, load the document that contains the Office Math equation you want to work with:

```java
Document doc = new Document(getMyDir() + "OfficeMath.docx");
```

### Step 2: Access the Office Math Object

Now, let's access the Office Math object within the document:

```java
OfficeMath officeMath = (OfficeMath) doc.getChild(NodeType.OFFICE_MATH, 0, true);
```

### Step 3: Set Display Type

You can control how the equation is displayed within the document. Use the `setDisplayType` method to specify whether it should be displayed inline with the text or on its line:

```java
officeMath.setDisplayType(OfficeMathDisplayType.DISPLAY);
```

### Step 4: Set Justification

You can also set the justification of the equation. For instance, let's align it to the left:

```java
officeMath.setJustification(OfficeMathJustification.LEFT);
```

### Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the document with the modified Office Math equation:

```java
doc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "ModifiedOfficeMath.docx");
```

## Complete Source Code For Using Office Math Objects in Aspose.Words for Java

```java
        Document doc = new Document(getMyDir() + "Office math.docx");
        OfficeMath officeMath = (OfficeMath) doc.getChild(NodeType.OFFICE_MATH, 0, true);
        // OfficeMath display type represents whether an equation is displayed inline with the text or displayed on its line.
        officeMath.setDisplayType(OfficeMathDisplayType.DISPLAY);
        officeMath.setJustification(OfficeMathJustification.LEFT);
        doc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "WorkingWithOfficeMath.MathEquations.docx");
```

## Conclusion
