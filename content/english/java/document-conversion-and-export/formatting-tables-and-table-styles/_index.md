## Introduction

When it comes to document formatting, tables play a crucial role in organizing and presenting data clearly. If you’re working with Java and Aspose.Words, you have powerful tools at your disposal for creating and formatting tables in your documents. Whether you're designing a simple table or applying advanced styles, Aspose.Words for Java offers a range of features to help you achieve professional-looking results.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of formatting tables and applying table styles using Aspose.Words for Java. You’ll learn how to set table borders, apply cell shading, and use table styles to enhance the appearance of your documents. By the end, you’ll have the skills to create well-formatted tables that make your data stand out.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed. Aspose.Words for Java requires a compatible JDK to run correctly.
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will help you manage your Java projects and streamline your development process.
3. Aspose.Words for Java Library: Download the latest version of Aspose.Words for Java [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/) and include it in your project.
4. Sample Code: We’ll be using some sample code snippets, so make sure you have a basic understanding of Java programming and how to integrate libraries into your project.

## Import Packages

To work with Aspose.Words for Java, you need to import the relevant packages into your project. These packages provide the classes and methods necessary for manipulating and formatting documents.

```java
import com.aspose.words.*;
```

This import statement gives you access to all the essential classes required for creating and formatting tables in your documents.

## Step 1: Formatting Tables

Formatting tables in Aspose.Words for Java involves setting borders, shading cells, and applying various formatting options. Here’s how you can do it:

### Load the Document

```java
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

### Create and Format the Table

```java
Table table = builder.startTable();
builder.insertCell();

// Set the borders for the entire table.
table.setBorders(LineStyle.SINGLE, 2.0, Color.BLACK);
        
// Set the cell shading for this cell.
builder.getCellFormat().getShading().setBackgroundPatternColor(Color.RED);
builder.writeln("Cell #1");

builder.insertCell();
        
// Specify a different cell shading for the second cell.
builder.getCellFormat().getShading().setBackgroundPatternColor(Color.GREEN);
builder.writeln("Cell #2");

builder.endRow();
```

### Customize Cell Borders

```java
// Clear the cell formatting from previous operations.
builder.getCellFormat().clearFormatting();

builder.insertCell();

// Create larger borders for the first cell of this row.
builder.getCellFormat().getBorders().getLeft().setLineWidth(4.0);
builder.getCellFormat().getBorders().getRight().setLineWidth(4.0);
builder.getCellFormat().getBorders().getTop().setLineWidth(4.0);
builder.getCellFormat().getBorders().getBottom().setLineWidth(4.0);
builder.writeln("Cell #3");

builder.insertCell();
builder.getCellFormat().clearFormatting();
builder.writeln("Cell #4");
        
doc.save("FormatTableAndCellWithDifferentBorders.docx");
```

### Explanation

In this example:
- Set Borders: We set the borders of the entire table to a single line style with a thickness of 2.0 points.
- Cell Shading: The first cell is shaded red, and the second cell is shaded green. This helps differentiate between cells visually.
- Cell Borders: For the third cell, we create thicker borders to highlight it differently from the rest.

## Step 2: Applying Table Styles

Table styles in Aspose.Words for Java allow you to apply predefined formatting options to tables, making it easier to achieve a consistent look. Here’s how to apply a style to your table:

### Create the Document and Table

```java
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

Table table = builder.startTable();
        
// We must insert at least one row first before setting any table formatting.
builder.insertCell();
```

### Apply Table Style

```java
// Set the table style based on a unique style identifier.
table.setStyleIdentifier(StyleIdentifier.MEDIUM_SHADING_1_ACCENT_1);
        
// Apply which features should be formatted by the style.
table.setStyleOptions(TableStyleOptions.FIRST_COLUMN | TableStyleOptions.ROW_BANDS | TableStyleOptions.FIRST_ROW);
table.autoFit(AutoFitBehavior.AUTO_FIT_TO_CONTENTS);
```

### Add Table Data

```java
builder.writeln("Item");
builder.getCellFormat().setRightPadding(40.0);
builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("Quantity (kg)");
builder.endRow();

builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("Apples");
builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("20");
builder.endRow();

builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("Bananas");
builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("40");
builder.endRow();

builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("Carrots");
builder.insertCell();
builder.writeln("50");
builder.endRow();

doc.save("BuildTableWithStyle.docx");
```

### Explanation

In this example:
- Set Table Style: We apply a predefined style (`MEDIUM_SHADING_1_ACCENT_1`) to the table. This style includes formatting for different parts of the table.
- Style Options: We specify that the first column, row bands, and first row should be formatted according to the style options.
- AutoFit: We use `AUTO_FIT_TO_CONTENTS` to ensure the table adjusts its size based on the content.
