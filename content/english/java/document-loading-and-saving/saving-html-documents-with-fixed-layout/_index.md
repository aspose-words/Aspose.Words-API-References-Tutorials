## Introduction to Saving HTML Documents with Fixed Layout in Aspose.Words for Java

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of saving HTML documents with a fixed layout using Aspose.Words for Java. With step-by-step instructions and code examples, you will learn how to achieve this seamlessly. So, let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java development environment set up.
- Aspose.Words for Java library installed and configured.

## Step 1: Loading the Document

First, we need to load the document that we want to save in HTML format. Here's how you can do it:

```java
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "YourDocument.docx");
```

Replace `"YourDocument.docx"` with the path to your Word document.

## Step 2: Configure HTML Fixed Save Options

To save the document with a fixed layout, we need to configure the `HtmlFixedSaveOptions` class. We'll set the `useTargetMachineFonts` property to `true` to ensure that the target machine's fonts are used in the HTML output:

```java
HtmlFixedSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlFixedSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setUseTargetMachineFonts(true);
```

## Step 3: Save the Document as HTML

Now, let's save the document as HTML with the fixed layout using the previously configured options:

```java
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "FixedLayoutDocument.html", saveOptions);
```

Replace `"FixedLayoutDocument.html"` with the desired name for your HTML file.
