## Introduction to Saving Documents as ODT Format in Aspose.Words for Java

In this article, we'll explore how to save documents as ODT (Open Document Text) format using Aspose.Words for Java. ODT is a popular open standard document format used by various office suites, including OpenOffice and LibreOffice. By saving documents in ODT format, you can ensure compatibility with these software packages.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2. Aspose.Words for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Words for Java library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

3. Sample Document: Have a sample Word document (e.g., "Document.docx") that you want to convert to ODT format.

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, let's load the Word document using Aspose.Words for Java:

```java
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Document.docx");
```

Here, `"Your Directory Path"` should point to the directory where your document is located.

## Step 2: Specify ODT Save Options

To save the document as ODT, we need to specify the ODT save options. Additionally, we can set the measurement unit for the document. Open Office uses centimeters, while MS Office uses inches. We'll set it to inches:

```java
OdtSaveOptions saveOptions = new OdtSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setMeasureUnit(OdtSaveMeasureUnit.INCHES);
```

## Step 3: Save the Document

Now, it's time to save the document in ODT format:

```java
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "WorkingWithOdtSaveOptions.MeasureUnit.odt", saveOptions);
```

Here, `"Your Directory Path"` should point to the directory where you want to save the converted ODT file.

## Complete Source Code For Saving Documents as ODT Format in Aspose.Words for Java
