## Introduction to Loading Text Files with Aspose.Words for Java

In this guide, we'll explore how to load text files using Aspose.Words for Java and manipulate them as Word documents. We'll cover various aspects such as detecting lists, handling spaces, and controlling text direction.

## Step 1: Detecting Lists

To load a text document and detect lists, you can follow these steps:

```java
// Create a plaintext document in the form of a string with parts that may be interpreted as lists.
// Upon loading, the first three lists will always be detected by Aspose.Words,
// and List objects will be created for them after loading.
final String TEXT_DOC = "Full stop delimiters:\n" +
        "1. First list item 1\n" +
        "2. First list item 2\n" +
        "3. First list item 3\n\n" +
        "Right bracket delimiters:\n" +
        "1) Second list item 1\n" +
        "2) Second list item 2\n" +
        "3) Second list item 3\n\n" +
        "Bullet delimiters:\n" +
        "• Third list item 1\n" +
        "• Third list item 2\n" +
        "• Third list item 3\n\n" +
        "Whitespace delimiters:\n" +
        "1 Fourth list item 1\n" +
        "2 Fourth list item 2\n" +
        "3 Fourth list item 3";
// The fourth list, with whitespace in between the list number and list item contents,
// will only be detected as a list if "DetectNumberingWithWhitespaces" in a LoadOptions object is set to true,
// to avoid paragraphs that start with numbers being mistakenly detected as lists.
TxtLoadOptions loadOptions = new TxtLoadOptions();
{
    loadOptions.setDetectNumberingWithWhitespaces(true);
}
// Load the document while applying LoadOptions as a parameter and verify the result.
Document doc = new Document(new ByteArrayInputStream(TEXT_DOC.getBytes()), loadOptions);
doc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "WorkingWithTxtLoadOptions.DetectNumberingWithWhitespaces.docx");
```

This code demonstrates how to load a text document with various list formats and use the `DetectNumberingWithWhitespaces` option to detect lists correctly.

## Step 2: Handling Spaces Options

To control leading and trailing spaces when loading a text document, you can use the following code:

```java
@Test
public void handleSpacesOptions() throws Exception {
    final String TEXT_DOC = "      Line 1 \n" +
            "    Line 2   \n" +
            " Line 3       ";
    TxtLoadOptions loadOptions = new TxtLoadOptions();
    {
        loadOptions.setLeadingSpacesOptions(TxtLeadingSpacesOptions.TRIM);
        loadOptions.setTrailingSpacesOptions(TxtTrailingSpacesOptions.TRIM);
    }
    Document doc = new Document(new ByteArrayInputStream(TEXT_DOC.getBytes()), loadOptions);
    doc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "WorkingWithTxtLoadOptions.HandleSpacesOptions.docx");
}
```

In this example, we load a text document and trim leading and trailing spaces using `TxtLeadingSpacesOptions.TRIM` and `TxtTrailingSpacesOptions.TRIM`.

## Step 3: Controlling Text Direction

To specify the text direction when loading a text document, you can use the following code:

```java
@Test
public void documentTextDirection() throws Exception {
    TxtLoadOptions loadOptions = new TxtLoadOptions();
    {
        loadOptions.setDocumentDirection(DocumentDirection.AUTO);
    }
    Document doc = new Document(getMyDir() + "Hebrew text.txt", loadOptions);
    Paragraph paragraph = doc.getFirstSection().getBody().getFirstParagraph();
    System.out.println(paragraph.getParagraphFormat().getBidi());
    doc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "WorkingWithTxtLoadOptions.DocumentTextDirection.docx");
}
```

This code sets the document direction to auto-detection (`DocumentDirection.AUTO`) and loads a text document with Hebrew text. You can adjust the document direction as needed.
