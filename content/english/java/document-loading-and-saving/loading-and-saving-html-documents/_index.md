## Introduction to Loading and Saving HTML Documents with Aspose.Words for Java

In this article, we will explore how to load and save HTML documents using the Aspose.Words for Java library. Aspose.Words is a powerful Java API that allows you to work with Word documents, and it provides various features for handling different document formats, including HTML. We will walk you through the process step by step, complete with source code examples.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Words for Java Library: You should have the Aspose.Words for Java library installed. If you haven't already, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

2. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.

## Loading HTML Documents

Let's start by loading an HTML document into a Word document using Aspose.Words. We will use the following HTML snippet as an example:

```java
final String HTML = "\r\n
					<html>\r\n
					<select name='ComboBox' size='1'>\r\n
					<option value='val1'>item1</option>\r\n
					<option value='val2'></option>\r\n
					</select>\r\n
					</html>\r\n";

HtmlLoadOptions loadOptions = new HtmlLoadOptions();
{
    loadOptions.setPreferredControlType(HtmlControlType.STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT_TAG);
}

Document doc = new Document(new ByteArrayInputStream(HTML.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), loadOptions);
```

In this code, we create an HTML string and use `HtmlLoadOptions` to specify that we want to treat the HTML as a structured document. We then load the HTML content into a `Document` object.

## Saving as Word Document

Now that we have loaded the HTML into a `Document`, we can save it as a Word document. Let's save it in DOCX format:

```java
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "WorkingWithHtmlLoadOptions.PreferredControlType.docx");
```

This code saves the `Document` as a DOCX file, which is a common format for Word documents.

					<option value='val2'></option>\r\n
					</select>\r\n
					</html>\r\n";
HtmlLoadOptions loadOptions = new HtmlLoadOptions();
{
	loadOptions.setPreferredControlType(HtmlControlType.STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT_TAG);
}
Document doc = new Document(new ByteArrayInputStream(HTML.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), loadOptions);
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "WorkingWithHtmlLoadOptions.PreferredControlType.docx");
```
