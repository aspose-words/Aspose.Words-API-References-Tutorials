## Introduction to Saving Documents as RTF Format in Aspose.Words for Java

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of saving documents as RTF (Rich Text Format) using Aspose.Words for Java. RTF is a commonly used format for documents that provides a high level of compatibility across various word processing applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Words for Java Library: Ensure that you have Aspose.Words for Java library integrated into your Java project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

2. A Document to Save: You should have an existing Word document (e.g., "Document.docx") that you want to save in RTF format.

## Step 1: Loading the Document

To get started, you need to load the document you want to save as RTF. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

// Load the source document (e.g., Document.docx)
Document doc = new Document("path/to/Document.docx");
```

Make sure to replace `"path/to/Document.docx"` with the actual path to your source document.

## Step 2: Configuring RTF Save Options

Aspose.Words provides various options for configuring the RTF output. In this example, we'll use `RtfSaveOptions` and set an option to save images as WMF (Windows Metafile) format within the RTF document.

```java
import com.aspose.words.RtfSaveOptions;

// Create an instance of RtfSaveOptions
RtfSaveOptions saveOptions = new RtfSaveOptions();

// Set the option to save images as WMF
saveOptions.setSaveImagesAsWmf(true);
```

You can customize other save options according to your requirements as well.

## Step 3: Saving the Document as RTF

Now that we have loaded the document and configured the RTF save options, it's time to save the document in RTF format.

```java
// Save the document in RTF format

doc.save("path/to/output.rtf", saveOptions);
```

Replace `"path/to/output.rtf"` with the desired path and filename for the RTF output file.
