Whether it's encrypting documents, handling metafiles, or managing picture bullets, Aspose.Words for Java provides a powerful API to streamline these processes. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to perform advanced saving options using Aspose.Words for Java.

## Introduction to Aspose.Words for Java

Before we dive into the code, let's briefly introduce Aspose.Words for Java. It's a robust Java library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert Word documents effortlessly. Whether you need to generate reports, add security, or format text, Aspose.Words for Java has you covered.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before you start coding, make sure you have the necessary environment set up:

1. Create a Document: Initialize a new document using Aspose.Words for Java.

```java
    Document doc = new Document();
    DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
    builder.write("Hello world!");
```

## Encrypting a Document with a Password

Now, let's dive into the first step - encrypting a document with a password. This adds an extra layer of security to your sensitive documents.

```java
DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions();
{
    saveOptions.setPassword("password");
}
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "EncryptedDocument.docx", saveOptions);
```

## Not Compressing Small Metafiles

Metafiles are essential in Word documents, but you may not want to compress small ones. Here's how to achieve this:

```java
@Test
public void doNotCompressSmallMetafiles() throws Exception {
    Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Microsoft equation object.docx");
    DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions();
    {
        saveOptions.setAlwaysCompressMetafiles(false);
    }
    doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "NotCompressedMetafiles.docx", saveOptions);
}
```

## Avoiding Saving Picture Bullets

Picture bullets can be eye-catching, but you might want to exclude them. Here's how:

```java
@Test
public void doNotSavePictureBullet() throws Exception {
    Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Image bullet points.docx");
    DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions();
    {
        saveOptions.setSavePictureBullet(false);
    }
    doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "NoPictureBullet.docx", saveOptions);
}
```
