## Introduction

Aspose.Words for Java is a robust library that allows you to work with Word documents programmatically. It provides a wide range of features, including document creation, manipulation, and formatting. In this guide, we will focus on two essential tasks: combining multiple documents into one and cloning a document while making modifications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the coding part, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- Aspose.Words for Java library
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

Now that we have our tools ready, let's get started.

## Combining Documents

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.Words

To begin, create a Java project in your IDE and add the Aspose.Words library to your project as a dependency. Then, initialize Aspose.Words in your code:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

public class DocumentCombination {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Aspose.Words
        Document doc = new Document();
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Load Source Documents

Next, you'll need to load the source documents that you want to combine. You can load multiple documents into separate instances of the `Document` class.

```java
// Load source documents
Document doc1 = new Document("document1.docx");
Document doc2 = new Document("document2.docx");
```

## Step 3: Combine Documents

Now that you have your source documents loaded, it's time to combine them into a single document.

```java
// Combine documents
doc1.appendDocument(doc2, Document.ImportFormatMode.KEEP_SOURCE_FORMATTING);
```

## Step 4: Save the Combined Document

Finally, save the combined document to a file.

```java
// Save the combined document
doc1.save("combined_document.docx");
```

## Cloning Documents

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.Words

Just like in the previous section, start by initializing Aspose.Words:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

public class DocumentCloning {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Aspose.Words
        Document doc = new Document("source_document.docx");
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Load the Source Document

Load the source document that you want to clone.

```java
// Load the source document
Document sourceDoc = new Document("source_document.docx");
```

## Step 3: Clone the Document

Clone the source document to create a new one.

```java
// Clone the document
Document clonedDoc = sourceDoc.deepClone();
```

## Step 4: Make Modifications

You can now make any necessary modifications to the cloned document.

```java
// Make modifications to the cloned document
clonedDoc.getFirstSection().getBody().getFirstParagraph().getRuns().get(0).setText("Modified Content");
```

## Step 5: Save the Cloned Document

Finally, save the cloned document to a file.

```java
// Save the cloned document
clonedDoc.save("cloned_document.docx");
```
