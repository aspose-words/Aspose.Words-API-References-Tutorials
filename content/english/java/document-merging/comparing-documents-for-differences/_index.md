## Introduction

Ever wondered how to spot every single difference between two Word documents? Maybe you’re revising a document or trying to find changes made by a collaborator. Manual comparisons can be tedious and error-prone, but with Aspose.Words for Java, it’s a breeze! This library enables you to automate document comparison, highlight revisions, and merge changes effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before jumping into the code, ensure you have the following ready:  
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.  
2. Aspose.Words for Java library. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).  
3. A development environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  
4. Basic familiarity with Java programming.  
5. A valid Aspose license. If you don’t have one, get a [temporary license here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Import Packages

To use Aspose.Words, you need to import the necessary classes. Below are the required imports:

```java
import com.aspose.words.*;
import java.util.Date;
```

Make sure these packages are correctly added to your project dependencies.


In this section, we’ll break down the process into simple steps.


## Step 1: Set Up Your Documents

To start, you need two documents: one representing the original and the other representing the edited version. Here’s how you create them:

```java
Document doc1 = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc1);
builder.writeln("This is the original document.");

Document doc2 = new Document();
builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc2);
builder.writeln("This is the edited document.");
```

This creates two documents in memory with basic content. You can also load existing Word documents using `new Document("path/to/document.docx")`.


## Step 2: Check for Existing Revisions

Revisions in Word documents represent tracked changes. Before comparing, ensure neither document contains pre-existing revisions:

```java
if (doc1.getRevisions().getCount() == 0 && doc2.getRevisions().getCount() == 0) {
    System.out.println("No revisions found. Proceeding with comparison...");
}
```

If revisions exist, you might want to accept or reject them before proceeding.


## Step 3: Compare the Documents

Use the `compare` method to find differences. This method compares the target document (`doc2`) with the source document (`doc1`):

```java
doc1.compare(doc2, "AuthorName", new Date());
```

Here:
- AuthorName is the name of the person making the changes.
- Date is the comparison timestamp.


## Step 4: Process Revisions

Once compared, Aspose.Words will generate revisions in the source document (`doc1`). Let’s analyze these revisions:

```java
for (Revision r : doc1.getRevisions()) {
    System.out.println("Revision type: " + r.getRevisionType());
    System.out.println("Node type: " + r.getParentNode().getNodeType());
    System.out.println("Changed text: " + r.getParentNode().getText());
}
```

This loop provides detailed information about each revision, such as the type of change and the affected text.


## Step 5: Accept All Revisions

If you want the source document (`doc1`) to match the target document (`doc2`), accept all revisions:

```java
doc1.getRevisions().acceptAll();
```

This updates `doc1` to reflect all the changes made in `doc2`.


## Step 6: Save the Updated Document

Finally, save the updated document to disk:

```java
doc1.save("Document.Compare.docx");
```

To confirm the changes, reload the document and verify there are no remaining revisions:

```java
doc1 = new Document("Document.Compare.docx");
if (doc1.getRevisions().getCount() == 0) {
    System.out.println("Documents are now identical.");
}
```


## Step 7: Verify Document Equality

To ensure the documents are identical, compare their text:

```java
if (doc1.getText().trim().equals(doc2.getText().trim())) {
    System.out.println("Documents are equal.");
}
```

If the texts match, congratulations—you’ve successfully compared and synchronized the documents!
