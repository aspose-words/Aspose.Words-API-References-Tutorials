## Introduction

Aspose.Words for Java is a feature-rich library that allows you to work with various document formats, including DOC, DOCX, RTF, and more. Joining and appending documents is a common task when dealing with document manipulation, and this guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions and Java code examples to achieve this seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Words for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Java Project

To get started, create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Make sure to include the Aspose.Words library in your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Initializing Aspose.Words

In your Java code, import the necessary Aspose.Words classes and initialize the library:

```java
import com.aspose.words.*;

public class DocumentJoiner {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize Aspose.Words
        License license = new License();
        license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.Java.lic");
    }
}
```

Ensure that you replace `"Aspose.Words.Java.lic"` with the path to your license file.

## Step 3: Loading Documents

To join or append documents, you first need to load them into memory. Let's load two sample documents for this example:

```java
// Load the source documents
Document doc1 = new Document("document1.docx");
Document doc2 = new Document("document2.docx");
```

## Step 4: Joining Documents

Now that we have our documents loaded, let's see how to join them together. In this example, we will join `doc2` to the end of `doc1`:

```java
// Join documents
doc1.appendDocument(doc2, ImportFormatMode.KEEP_SOURCE_FORMATTING);
```

The `ImportFormatMode.KEEP_SOURCE_FORMATTING` option ensures that the formatting of the source documents is preserved.

## Step 5: Saving the Result

To save the joined document to a file, you can use the following code:

```java
// Save the joined document
doc1.save("joined_document.docx");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to join and append documents using Aspose.Words for Java. This versatile library empowers you to manipulate documents effortlessly, making it an invaluable tool for Java developers.
