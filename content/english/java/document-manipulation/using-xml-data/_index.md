## Introduction to Using XML Data in Aspose.Words for Java

In this guide, we'll explore how to work with XML data using Aspose.Words for Java. You'll learn how to perform mail merge operations, including nested mail merges, and utilize the Mustache syntax with a DataSet. We'll provide step-by-step instructions and source code examples to help you get started.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) installed.
- Sample XML data files for customers, orders, and vendors.
- Sample Word documents for mail merge destinations.

## Mail Merge with XML Data

### 1. Basic Mail Merge

To perform a basic mail merge with XML data, follow these steps:

```java
DataSet customersDs = new DataSet();
customersDs.readXml("Your Directory Path" + "Mail merge data - Customers.xml");
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Mail merge destinations - Registration complete.docx");
doc.getMailMerge().execute(customersDs.getTables().get("Customer"));
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "BasicMailMerge.docx");
```

### 2. Nested Mail Merge

For nested mail merges, use the following code:

```java
DataSet pizzaDs = new DataSet();
pizzaDs.readXml("Your Directory Path" + "Mail merge data - Orders.xml");
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Mail merge destinations - Invoice.docx");
doc.getMailMerge().setTrimWhitespaces(false);
doc.getMailMerge().executeWithRegions(pizzaDs);
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "NestedMailMerge.docx");
```

## Mustache Syntax Using DataSet

To leverage the Mustache syntax with a DataSet, follow these steps:

```java
DataSet ds = new DataSet();
ds.readXml("Your Directory Path" + "Mail merge data - Vendors.xml");
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Mail merge destinations - Vendor.docx");
doc.getMailMerge().setUseNonMergeFields(true);
doc.getMailMerge().executeWithRegions(ds);
doc.save("Your Directory Path" + "MustacheSyntaxUsingDataSet.docx");
```

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we've explored how to effectively use XML data with Aspose.Words for Java. You've learned how to perform various mail merge operations, including basic mail merge, nested mail merge, and how to utilize the Mustache syntax with a DataSet. These techniques empower you to automate document generation and customization with ease.

## FAQ's

### How can I prepare my XML data for mail merge?

Make sure your XML data follows the required structure, with tables and relationships defined, as shown in the provided examples.

### Can I customize the trim behavior for mail merge values?

Yes, you can control whether leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed during mail merge by using `doc.getMailMerge().setTrimWhitespaces(false)`.

### What is the Mustache syntax, and when should I use it?

The Mustache syntax allows you to format mail merge fields in a more flexible way. Use `doc.getMailMerge().setUseNonMergeFields(true)` to enable Mustache syntax.
