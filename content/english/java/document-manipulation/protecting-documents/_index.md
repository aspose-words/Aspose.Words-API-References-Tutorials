## Introduction to Document Protection

Document protection is a vital feature when dealing with sensitive information. Aspose.Words for Java provides robust capabilities to protect your documents from unauthorized access.

## Protecting Documents with Passwords

To protect your documents, you can set a password. Only users who know the password will be able to access the document. Let's see how to do it in code:

```java
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Document.docx");
doc.protect(ProtectionType.ALLOW_ONLY_FORM_FIELDS, "password");
```

In the code above, we load a Word document and protect it with a password, allowing only form fields to be edited.

## Removing Document Protection

If you need to remove the protection from a document, Aspose.Words for Java makes it easy:

```java
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Document.docx");
doc.unprotect();
```

The `unprotect` method removes any protection applied to the document, making it accessible without a password.

## Checking Document Protection Type

You may want to determine the protection type applied to a document programmatically:

```java
Document doc = new Document("Your Directory Path" + "Document.docx");
int protectionType = doc.getProtectionType();
```

The `getProtectionType` method returns an integer representing the protection type applied to the document.
