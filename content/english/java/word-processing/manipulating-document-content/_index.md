Now that you are equipped with the necessary prerequisites, let's proceed to the core concepts of manipulating document content.

## Cleaning Up Document Content

Cleaning up document content is often essential to ensure the integrity and consistency of your documents. Aspose.Words for Java provides several tools and methods for this purpose.

### Removing Unused Styles

Unnecessary styles can clutter your documents and affect performance. Use the following code to remove them:

```java
Document doc = new Document("document.docx");
doc.cleanup();
doc.save("cleaned_document.docx");
```

### Deleting Empty Paragraphs

Empty paragraphs can be a nuisance. Remove them using this code:

```java
Document doc = new Document("document.docx");
doc.getRange().getParagraphs().removeIf(p -> p.getText().trim().isEmpty());
doc.save("document_without_empty_paragraphs.docx");
```

### Stripping Hidden Content

Hidden content might exist in your documents, potentially causing issues during processing. Eliminate it with this code:

```java
Document doc = new Document("document.docx");
doc.getRange().getRuns().removeIf(run -> run.getFont().getHidden());
doc.save("document_stripped_of_hidden_content.docx");
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your document is clean and ready for further manipulation.

## Working with Fields

Fields in documents allow dynamic content, such as dates, page numbers, and document properties. Aspose.Words for Java simplifies working with fields.

### Updating Fields

To update all fields in your document, use the following code:

```java
Document doc = new Document("document.docx");
doc.updateFields();
doc.save("document_with_updated_fields.docx");
```

### Inserting Fields

You can also insert fields programmatically:

```java
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.insertField("MERGEFIELD Date");
builder.insertField("PAGE");
doc.save("document_with_inserted_fields.docx");
```

Fields add dynamic capabilities to your documents, enhancing their utility.

## Incorporating XML Data

Integrating XML data into your documents can be powerful, especially for generating dynamic content. Aspose.Words for Java simplifies this process.

### Binding XML Data

Bind XML data to your document with ease:

```java
Document doc = new Document("template.docx");
XmlMapping xmlMapping = doc.getRange().getXmlMapping();
xmlMapping.setMappingName("customer");
xmlMapping.setXPath("/order/customer");
xmlMapping.setPrefixMappings("xmlns:ns='http://schemas.example'");
doc.save("document_with_xml_data.docx");
```

This code binds XML data to specific parts of your document, making it dynamic and data-driven.
